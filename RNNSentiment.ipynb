            "[general] first of all let me welcome all of you to pakistan  \n",
            "[development] the irony is that 41 years ago the extraordinary meeting of the oic was held in pakistan  \n",
            "[policy] it was discussing afghanistan  \n",
            "[governance] and since then all the troubles of afghanistan started  \n",
            "[governance] no country no country has suffered as much as afghanistan  \n",
            "[governance] 40 years of conflict  \n",
            "[development] and then add to it recently prolonged drought  \n",
            "[welfare] 75 of the people living off the land  \n",
            "[welfare] and then even before 15th of august half the population below the poverty line  \n",
            "[corruption] years of corrupt governance  \n",
            "[finance] 75 percent of the budget supported by foreign aid  \n",
            "[governance] now a country in this situation after 15th august  \n",
            "[finance] if the foreign aid drives up the foreign reserves get frozen  \n",
            "[finance] banking system freezes  \n",
            "[governance] any country is going to collapse let alone afghanistan which has suffered for the past 40 years  \n",
            "[general] so i'm really glad all the speakers before me mentioned the gravity of the situation  \n",
            "[general] especially i would like to point out what michael griffith under secretary of the uh of the united nations uh secretary general what he had to say the figures he gave  \n",
            "[policy] so the point is that if the world does not act this will be the biggest man-made crisis which is unfolding in front of us  \n",
            "[action] we the oic it's a big responsibility on us  \n",
            "[governance] because not only is it the situated situation in afghanistan as it unfolds but it's a religious duty to help them  \n",
            "[action] and i must say that we have to  \n",
            "[action] and i and i speak to uh the united states specifically they must de-link the taliban government from the 40 million of one citizens  \n",
            "[people] even if they have they've been in conflict with taliban for 40 years 20 years but this is a question of the people of afghanistan  \n",
            "[people] 40 million human beings  \n",
            "[action] and that's why it is very important that action is taken immediately  \n",
            "[general] already we are late  \n",
            "[general] the afan winter everyone knows is extremely severe  \n",
            "[policy] and these uh preconditions the taliban have to uh unless they have an inclusive government human rights women rights do not allow terrorism from the soil  \n",
            "[policy] unless these preconditions are met the humanitarian aid will not flow  \n",
            "[finance] and their foreign reserves won't be they won't be allowed to have them  \n",
            "[finance] or the banking system won't function won't be allowed to function  \n",
            "[governance] this is very important that first of all my the one time i met the taliban foreign minister he categorically said that they they wanted to uh comply with these three conditions  \n",
            "[general] now the point is we must understand that every when we talk about human rights every society is different  \n",
            "[policy] every society's idea of human rights and women rights are different  \n",
            "[development] i'd just give you an example of uh of of the pakistan the pathway province which borders afghanistan  \n",
            "[development] because the culture is similar because they are taliban is basically predominantly a pashtun movement and there are more pistons on our side of the border  \n",
            "[general] now the city culture is completely different with the rural culture  \n",
            "[development] kabul culture in kabul was always different to rural areas  \n",
            "[general] just like in peshawar it is completely different the culture to the district adjoining the afghanistan border  \n",
            "[policy] so i give you an example we give stipends to the girl's child's parents to put the girls into school  \n",
            "[policy] but in our tribal districts or the district joining afghanistan if we if the if the if we are not sensitive to the cultural norms of the those people  \n",
            "[policy] even with stipends they won't send the girls to school  \n",
            "[development] but if we are sensitive to their cultural norms without stipends they are willing to send the girls to school  \n",
            "[policy] so this sensitivity i'm afraid when we are talking about human rights and women rights we have to be sensitive about this  \n",
            "[action] but my big worry is that unless action is taken immediately and i mean immediately because we've been saying this for now two three months  \n",
            "[governance] unless action is taken immediately afghanistan is heading for chaos  \n",
            "[governance] any government when you can't pay salaries of its public servants hospital doctors nurses any government is going to collapse  \n",
            "[governance] but chaos suits no one  \n",
            "[general] it certainly does not suit the united states  \n",
            "[governance] because what if there's chaos there  \n",
            "[governance] and chaos means the inability if the ifan government does not have the ability to fight terrorism  \n",
            "[governance] and we know isil is now a threat  \n",
            "[governance] it has been a threat  \n",
            "[governance] we have had attacks from a foreign border from isil into pakistan  \n",
            "[action] so the only way you can control what is an isil is capable of international terrorism  \n",
            "[governance] and the only reason you can deal with it is if this is stable afghan government  \n",
            "[governance] and same with pakistan our worry is  \n",
            "[welfare] and remember pakistan lost 80 000 people  \n",
            "[governance] we were the biggest collateral damage of the iran war  \n",
            "[finance] our economy was shattered over 100 billion dollars lost to the economy  \n",
            "[welfare] three and a half million people internally displaced  \n",
            "[welfare] with the last thing we want is a chaos in afghanistan more refugees  \n",
            "[welfare] we already have over three billion of one refugees to date  \n",
            "[welfare] we have 234 thousand of ones who have overstayed the visa because they do not they their situation in afghanistan means they can't go back  \n",
            "[finance] and remember this is a country like most developing countries who are suffering from the fallout of the coronavirus  \n",
            "[finance] grover 19 we are all suffering from the impact it has had on world economies  \n",
            "[governance] so we had no position to deal with this another influx of refugees and and terrorism  \n",
            "[action] so my request to the international community to the united states specifically  \n",
            "[general] i know the europeans are extremely sensitive they understand the situation  \n",
            "[welfare] there's a refugee problem not just in europe all over the world  \n",
            "[governance] so everyone knows that this chaos will lead not just countries like pakistan and iran other countries will also eventually have refugee problems  \n",
            "[welfare] but in in much richer countries you have two three thousand refugees and there's an issue the far right parties raised this issue about refugees  \n",
            "[welfare] but we poor countries you know who are struggling whose economy is just about getting on their feet how do we cope with hundreds and thousands of refugees  \n",
            "[general] so it is in no one's interest that there's chaos in afghanistan  \n",
            "[action] and that's why i was very uh impressed by the islamic development bank's suggestions of immediate medium and long-term ways of helping the people of afghanistan making the economy sustainable  \n",
            "[action] i would look forward to the foreign ministers that you will come up with a road map by the end of this evening  \n",
            "[policy] and that road map not only should be pushed by the oic by the united nations by the european union and by of course the united states  \n",
            "[general] because as i repeat chaos in afghanistan suits no one  \n",
            "[general] and finally because i have this platform of the oic foreign ministers i would just raise two more points  \n",
            "[people] one is palestine and kashmir  \n",
            "[people] the people of palestine and kashmir look to us  \n",
            "[policy] they want to see a unified response from us about the human rights about the democratic rights rights which united nations security council resolutions have given them and unfortunately not implemented  \n",
            "[action] we should on every forum raise our voices and a unified stance  \n",
            "[general] and lastly i want to talk about islamophobia  \n",
            "[general] unfortunately the refugee crisis in western countries has exacerbated islamophobia  \n",
            "[general] islamophobia really started reaching a dangerous levels after 9 11  \n",
            "[general] when terrorism and islam were connected  \n",
            "[general] when radical word terms like radical islam came they connected somehow islam was was responsible for terrorism and radicalizing radicalization  \n",
            "[general] so this connection has made life difficult for people living in western countries  \n",
            "[people] muslims living in western countries  \n",
            "[general] the man in the street in the west cannot distinguish between what is a moderate muslim and what is a radical muslim  \n",
            "[general] so you have stuff like in new zealand a man walks into a mosque and shoots 50 people  \n",
            "[corruption] it's because these this term radical islam islamic terrorism they have to be delinked  \n",
            "[general] and secondly the reason for islamophobia is people in the west do not understand  \n",
            "[general] when our prophet muhammad sallam is mocked or ridiculed or insulted they can't understand the reaction amongst the muslims  \n",
            "[general] because their attitude to religion is different to us  \n",
            "[general] so it's very important for the oic to play its part in explaining to the western world on forums like european union united nations they think tanks  \n",
            "[general] making them understand rather than this gap growing between muslims and non-muslims because of inability to understand islam  \n",
            "[responsibility] it is our responsibility in the oic that we make them understand  \n",
            "[governance] we have in pakistan formed an authority it's called ramatulla mean authority  \n",
            "[policy] the purpose is to have top pakistani scholars in this authority who coordinate with muslim scholars all over the world  \n",
            "[policy] and one of the objectives of this uh remember allah almighty authority is that there should be a considered intellectual response when things like a cartoon appears insulting a holy prophet peace be upon him  \n",
            "[action] there should be a proper response from scholars to make them understand why muslims react that the love and reverence we have for a holy prophet peace be upon him  \n",
            "[general] because they don't understand this  \n",
            "[general] and secondly to make them understand that a holy prophet was called ramatulla alameen he was to bring mercy for mankind he was not called ramatul muslimeen he was not just for muslims  \n",
            "[general] just like our god allah is god of all human beings  \n",
            "[general] so a prophet united human beings his whole message was of love  \n",
            "[general] but this is not the people in the west do not understand this  \n",
            "[general] there is so much propaganda against islam  \n",
            "[general] and unfortunately we do not have a coherent and an intellectual scholarly response to this  \n",
            "[action] so one objective of this authority is to in coordination with all the muslim scholars we will respond  \n",
            "[policy] and we would like the oic secretary general also to to know about this response  \n",
            "[general] we will consult you and whenever anything happens there should be a proper response to that  \n",
            "[governance] but secondly it's also for my own country  \n",
            "[governance] because we feel that we can raise the morality and the ethics of our society by making people understand the seerth of the prophet his teachings  \n",
            "[governance] to raise the ethical standards in our country and at the same time unite our people  \n",
            "[general] because unfortunately religion is used by elements in our society to divide people spread hatred  \n",
            "[action] the whole idea is to unite human beings uh under the teachings of a prophet  \n",
            "[general] so finally i again welcome all of you  \n",
            "[general] i hope we have we have a very productive session this afternoon  \n",
            "[action] and then we come up with a very coherent uh a strategy which i said immediate medium term and long term how to get afghanistan out of this crisis  \n",
            "[general] thank you  \n",

            "1. [general] That this alarm is in advance that I have my head in the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mirza Sahib, first of all I want to press the state tehsil to you that what you exported and I did for the construction industry, then you also have every request for this.\n",
            "2. [action] I press the tehsil and anyway the alarm I went to the stalls and loudly got the input and one of your benefits is that this convention center is made an expo center in Islamism, this is a very good suggestion of Himanshu Allah and I will cancel it right now, have you told the pet members and I will decide it as friends, but first of all, a very easy adjective, what is Pakistan's, so that the loot, when I tell you the mark, will end inside it, I will tell you what all the things.\n",
            "3. [welfare] If we fit that bhajan within that vision, then first of all Vishnu of Pakistan is that we have taken our people out of this fast that about 40 percent of our population is below the starting line of 25 and we are suffering further.\n",
            "4. [welfare] Twenty to twenty-five percent, which is exactly its method, so my first thought is that how do we uplift them, what are the consequences of Pakistan, what are its roots, how have we grown, how to become wealth creators, how can we unite in this country.\n",
            "5. [development] Mukesh was on one thing in the sixties when we were growing up that he was moving ahead very fast, all these people who used to look towards Asian Tiger go to Pakistan, Malaysia came and explained to Pakistan how to move ahead, South Korea told Pakistan to move ahead.\n",
            "6. [development] The first five year plan of Pakistan is that when we studied, we were looking for a model of development and then we saw that curve going down in front of our eyes, so the second thing is how to take Pakistan to that point.\n",
            "7. [finance] Which is its potential, there is a lot of tension in the report because if that tension had been there, it would have been rising rapidly, had we not been outstanding Piya, this big airline had become our bank judge at this time, otherwise if there had been nationalization, then every stop would have been obsessed with tanning banks.\n",
            "8. [corruption] BCCI went and made it the talk time of the world, then it became a bank, then everything helped, Pakistan was once again going up at a very fast pace, so how can we bring it back to improve its real function and what steps can you take on it?\n",
            "9. [general] He has to go there and then it is related to him that a Maulvi himself is at the arm hole that these have to be taken from the mixer.\n",
            "10. [action] Have you ever come to me? I have gone to you 20 times because we are in our call me marriage.\n",
            "11. [finance] And then a small section has become so rich that it is out for them i.e. I had to go out big for Maximum Retail, I had to go out because of cricket but to collect money for Paanch Chowk Thanam, I collected money from Pakistanis.\n",
            "12. [finance] If I did, there were rich Pakistanis there, that money was with them and that too i.e. they will not message you that the condition of Pakistan is that they have to take loan and if they have to take loan in Ahmedabad, then people are rich but Urs e, that is why there is Beckham Balance.\n",
            "13. [general] That when the system has been received, then this logic starts below, it also becomes a little flat, does n't he give the text, he Ram Shyam, his holidays in London are positive and shopping, but the common man, he can hardly fill his Hanji wrinkles.\n",
            "14. [corruption] If a person does this then by doing one correction it becomes a system, all these are the roots here, the rulers and their ruling elite are bad, they are the last ones in all those issues, despite the huge number of abortions, there is even a little bit of big opposition outside them.\n",
            "15. [corruption] There are big malavats of all the developing countries that this is the story, so how to change it, so this is my big plan, this is the last thing, then the rule of law, after the power of 10:00 am, do that work and do justice.\n",
            "16. [action] With time, this change will come that now he will raise people from above but from below, there are big ways to do this.\n",
            "17. [development] Firstly, we are coming with a complete realization program, now it is general, it has been mentioned in the country that ' Successful Pakistan Inshallah', you will see that this is only Not only within Pakistan, this Developing World 10th will become an example of how a work can uplift the weaker section of the society.\n",
            "18. [welfare] Whatever work we do within it, we have done it before in Pakistan and by launching it with great fanfare on this Ishq Wala Love date.\n",
            "19. [welfare] Is there any program, what will happen that our 40 percent Chetak is given to every family, every family, you see this, this is a big impress program, for every family, technical education will be given to the duty of one family, especially you who are in the IT sector.\n",
            "20. [welfare] You can train people very quickly in this and they can start earning money very quickly that a health card will be issued to a family.\n",
            "21. [welfare] Health card means that for Rs 10 lakh, they can go to any hospital and get themselves treated as per the family's duty.\n",
            "22. [finance] There are many other things which will be broken into pieces so that if in the city then he can do his business in his shop or on his scooter and if in the country then he can do his business without the suit for a farmer.\n",
            "23. [finance] One person will get a loan and the people and landmarks that till now in Pakistan, there was talk about bread, clothes and houses but no work was ever done on it.\n",
            "24. [finance] Now through microfinance we will finance him for a family to build his own house.\n",
            "25. [action] That's why I need a screen protector because people don't have what they need to build a house, so it is spreading inside our cities.\n",
            "26. [development] Chief, congratulations.\n",
            "27. [development] Karachi has become a dam with almost 40 per cent of the expenditure, how can people have it when Will it be tasty and what else can we make on top of it?\n",
            "28. [action] So, we have struggled a lot to remove this law which is called follow from the substances, till it will be legal that if someone does not pay the installment then if it is a bank then he will be able to take it.\n",
            "29. [policy] But if they do it then they will give it, that is why there is no concept of house pension in Pakistan, these two percent taxes are still paid for houses in Pakistan, which is double the big issue with us, it has reached 10 percent and Malaysia.\n",
            "30. [policy] There is 30 percent house function in India and 80% Shivpravah in Europe and America, so what is not hidden in our country and do that hunting, it took us two years to pass this law with great effort, this Pandey law was passed, so you can see it for the first time.\n",

i brought your attention over a thousand years review of literature in our history shows nothing but respect [general] there is not a single joke that you can find because the prophet's life and his tradition is syrah embodies the perfect muslims behavior and as a guide to all of us [welfare] i'd like to thank you and assure you of our cooperation and making sure that our occidental counterparts understand that positive freedom and negative freedom need to be differentiated [general] negative freedom is a freedom the exercise of which hurts other people [welfare] and the place of the of our prophet uh in our islamic belief culture and civilization is such that respect for the prophet is respect for the entire muslim world [policy] mr prime minister you come with a series of very important messages that yourself will articulate [governance] but fundamental to this is that violence is not an answer [policy] a comprehensive political settlement for an enduring peace within the framework of our values our constitution in the islamic republic is the way to the future [action] within this we can move forward and a comprehensive at the request of the afghan people is for a comprehensive ceasefire as soon as that would be feasible [action] all of us need to understand that resort to violence the region is shown in your convince from your personal experience is not an answer [policy] embracing a constructive politics a politics of engagement in inclusive politics is the way to the future [action] practically we've agreed to form committees to deal with key topics

within a short period i would be honored to accept your invitation to visit the islamic republic of pakistan [general] thank you for coming and thanks to all your colleagues for their very productive and constructive engagement [governance] mr prime minister president ghani first of all thank you for your invitation to visit kabul [general] i had been planning for at least 50 years to visit afghanistan and kabul but i it never happened so i'm pleased that you invited me and i had an opportunity to visit this historic city [general] i know all about the history of afghanistan and i noticed that you know a lot about the history of pakistan and what is india [general] so we are both students of history and therefore kabul is one of those cities which of immense interest to us [general] and afghanistan until in this in the 60s and 70s the favorite place for pakistanis to visit was kabul [general] and a lot of people from afghanistan used to be visiting peshawar was a place for them to visit [general] so we have historical links we have connections we have relations between the two countries [general] so my i the whole idea of coming at a time when violence is increasing in in afghanistan is to assure you [welfare] uh mr president that we the people of pakistan the government of pakistan have only one concern and that concern is what you are feeling in afghanistan that we want peace [welfare] we feel that people of afghanistan have suffered for four decades and it the if ever a human community needed peace it's it's afghanistan [welfare] and it is now [governance] pakistan played its role in getting the first the taliban to talk to the americans and then the intra afghan dialogue [governance] and we noticed with concern that the level of violence despite the talks in qatar despite the talks the level of violence is rising [action] so my idea of choosing this time to come was to assure you that we will pakistan will do everything whatever is possible [action] we will do to help reduce this violence [action] in fact move towards the ceasefire [cooperation] we have formed committees as you've said [cooperation] the idea of committees is to ensure that there's communication between us between our security agencies [action] whenever you feel that there's somewhere pakistan can help in reducing the violence please let us know [action] we assure you that whatever possible whatever possible within our grasp within our reach whatever we can do we assure you that we will be we will be doing utmost to reduce this level of violence [welfare] pakistan is the country after afghanistan which is most interested in peace in afghanistan [welfare] and the reason is the tribal areas of pakistan what was the ex fatah which is now got merged into pakhtunkhwa [welfare] the the ex-fatah region the tribal areas were devastated by the war on terror half of the population was internally displaced [welfare] their livelihood was badly affected [finance] uh billions and billions and of rupees of damage was done there [action] and so the best way we can help those people and uh and people on both sides of the border is if there is peace and there's trade there's connectivity [cooperation] so we uh a commerce minister had very fruitful talks in the past three days [cooperation] uh we hope that this trade and connectivity will increase between the two countries [policy] and for that it is imperative that the level of violence goes down [general] so i repeat again mr president that the whole objective of this visit is to build trust [cooperation] uh to to communicate more to assure you that whatever you need a help we will be more you more than your expectations we will be inshallah helping you [general] thank you so

            "[general]   [general] valera one rahim madam gouget members of CC PID ladies and gentlemen let me first say that I want to celebrate with you the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China [general] we have seen how China has struggled then learned from its mistakes and then how today China is the fastest growing economy of the world [development] so we have watched China [general] there was a time when Pakistan was considered one of the fastest growing countries in Asia in the 60s [development] and we heard that China learnt a bit from Pakistan and now is the time for Pakistan to learn from China [cooperation] personally the thing that inspires me most about China what inspires me most about China is the way they have lifted 700 million people out of poverty in 30 years [welfare] this has never happened in human history and for someone who cares about humanity I think this is an example which the entire world can follow and learn from China [welfare] so for me this is the most important thing Pakistan can learn the way China has lifted people out of poverty [welfare] and what I have understood so far China allowed the businesses to make money [finance] China concentrated on their special economic zones [development] the export zones they brought in investment from outside they created wealth and from that wealth creation they spent it on the less privileged poorer section of the society [welfare] and that's how they've achieved the miracle and that's what we intend to do in Pakistan [development] the other thing I've learned from China is the way China has tackled corruption [corruption] President Xi Jinping's one of his biggest crusade has been against corruption [corruption] and from what I hear correct me if I'm wrong that some 400 deep ministerial-level people in the last five years have been convicted on corruption put behind jail [corruption] and then you know I read in the papers now I don't know whether it is true that there was a Chinese bear tons of gold was found in his room and within five days he was convicted [corruption] so why is this very important for not just Pakistan but most of the developing world to learn from [general] because the most important thing is if you have corruption it stops investment [corruption][finance] corruption is one of the biggest impediments an investment coming into your country [corruption][finance] the reason one of the main reasons why we have not been able to develop this great potential of Pakistan has been the fact that red tape ISM and red tape ISM is also because of corruption [corruption][development] when you slow down by slowing down procedures through red tape it is a way of getting speed money captian money and corruption [corruption] when firms have the opportunity of they can invest anywhere in the world they will always invest in economies that are cleaner economies with less impediments in the way of investment [finance] so I wish I could follow president Xi's example and put 500 corrupt people in Pakistan in jail [corruption] but unfortunately he unfortunately we have a very cumbersome process and so we hope in time we will improve it [governance] but I do believe that this is something also the way China has gone ahead the way they have learned from their experiences [general] I went to the Chinese Communist Party and they explained to me that process of meritocracy how everything is analyzed how there's a constant think-tank thinking of how to improve themselves [governance] so this is remarkable about the way you China has gone ahead and and looks like it would leave all the countries behind within the next decade [development] now Pakistan since my government has come into power we have taken a conscious decision that we will make it easier and easier for investment investors to come in to Pakistan [finance][development] and we will warn them to make profits at Pakistan [finance] we will encourage profitability [finance] we had a mindset where businesses when they started making profit there was some sort of an EM venous system in a bureaucracy amongst the politicians and they would somehow want to pull them down [governance] this government is the first couple since 1960s which is encouraging businesses Dow which wants them to make profits in Pakistan which wants them to get rich in Pakistan [finance] and by the prime minister's office Prime Minister's Office is driving this the opportunities for people to invest in our country [finance] the ease of doing business is driven from the Prime Minister's office [governance] now we have just formed a CPAC Authority because we were having problems in CPAC projects because they were on a lot of different ministries [governance] now we have decided that there will be one Authority which will resolve all the problems of CPAC and that Authority will be the Prime Minister office so that it can my office can make it easier for people investing in Pakistan [governance] people from China investigate Pakistan [cooperation] I'm pleased to say that we have done a few things which I will tell you [general] we have in go other port and phase one of gabbatha free zone that has been completed and guada Airport will soon be completed work has started on it [development] gadis go odda as you know is the is the port one of the the whole idea of CPAC initially was to connect China to the Indian Ocean and to the go other port [cooperation] so we have also now kavadis smart port city master plan has been approved [development] finally it took us time concessions for go other port and free zone have been improved approved issues of tariffs and pending payments on energy project projects have been resolved in the phase 2 of CPAC our cooperation will focus on industrial cooperation agriculture very important agriculture [cooperation] Pakistan as one of the most fertile lands but unfortunately one of the lowest productivity and that's what we hope to learn from the Chinese experience of your high productivity seed development in water management in fisheries especially so that is the next emphasis [cooperation] and why justice by Commerce Minister said why should people invest in Pakistan [finance] so there are five reasons which I want to again repeat [general] Pakistan's strategic location Pakistan is one of the most strategic located places in the world [development] number two we have a population of two hundred and twenty million people and unlike China Pakistan's 60% of Pakistanis are below the age of thirty [people] one of the youngest populations which is which means a vibrant population a young vibrant population labor force [people] and then we have started this economic revival through reforms [finance] you will be pleased to know those who want to invest in Pakistan that in the ease of doing business Pakistan has made the biggest strides [finance] we have gone up the greatest number in the whole of South Asia and overall in the world we are number eight in a country that has made the greatest advances in ease of doing business [finance] and then of course the industrial clusters through special economic zones we are working on them some have moved ahead others a little bit slow but we are now especially concentrated concentrating on our special economic zones [development] and where do we want Chinese investment we would love them we would want Chinese investors to come [cooperation] I met this morning they're very powerful Chinese investors some already there and some who want to expand their investment so I've met them and I must say I was very happy this morning but the quality of investors we have so we will facilitate them [finance] but the sector's we want Chinese investments is number one textile because Pakistan is one of the biggest producers of cotton [finance] manufacturing IT and financial services we would like your people to come and help us [finance] their physical and technological logistics food processing and agriculture tourism and hospitality [development] Pakistan is one of the most untapped tourist potential places in the world [development] we have out of the six out of the 12 or 13 highest peaks over twenty to four thousand in the world six sign Pakistan [development] Pakistan's northern areas are the twice the size of Switzerland and it has diversity different types of mountains it has desert it has plains it has thousand kilometers of seacoast [general] so it has it is very diverse a country which is not untapped for tourism so far [development] secondly Pakistan is one of the most for religious tourism it is one of the most sought-after place for Buddhism it was one of the centers of Buddhism tekzilla was one of the centers of Buddhism [general] then for Sikhism then for Hinduism and then even for Christians it has the highest number of church churches in a non Muslim in a non-christian city [general] thus Pakistan is one of the well I can't say this here because China is one of the oldest civilizations in the world but compared to the other countries in the world pockets that is one of the oldest countries with a 5,000 years old Indus Valley Civilisation [general] housing we are just starting on one of the most ambitious plans of housing in Pakistan [development] we have decided to build five million houses in five years [development] Pakistan has a huge shortage of houses we have we have at least a demand of ten million houses right now [welfare] so there's a big shortage so we are trying to build in the next years five million houses and affordable houses for people who can who cannot buy expensive houses [welfare] so we would appreciate we would invite Chinese investment there [cooperation] and then oil and gas in oil and gas we have huge areas which they we haven't had because of policies that discouraged drilling [finance] we haven't had much interest in there because now we have initiated policies for companies to come and drill in oil and gas [finance] and then of course one of the biggest copper and gold reserves we have big gold reserves in Pakistan and in third so we already have Chinese companies in both in gold as well as in gold [finance] six security situation in Pakistan has improved there was a time when people were scared to come to Pakistan because of a security situation [governance] thanks to by intelligence agencies our security forces Pakistan is now one of the safest places and so that no longer is the issue [governance] but we have specially created security forces to protect our Chinese workers there [governance] so for Chinese we have actually created a special force so that you know to provide them extra security [governance] a liberal visa regime we have liberalized a visa regime for Chinese nationals they can actually come and get visa at the airport [governance] this was not the case before we had a very difficult visa regime [governance] so that has been that has been eased up and it is also for seventy other countries we have allowed them to come and get visas at the airport [governance] all the major cities of Pakistan are connected with air routes now [development] and actually to vote for the Chinese business community this is now exactly where China was in 1978 this is where Pakistan is now [development] it's a great time to come and invest in the country [finance] a labor cost as my Minister of Commerce said our labor cost is only about 20 percent twenty percent of what is what is the labor cost in China [finance] so there is a comparative advantage now we have of course developing the free trade trade agreement with China now to the next phase we are developing that further [cooperation] and Pakistan of course because of its location it gives Chinese companies coming into Pakistan to react sport from Pakistan it's much easier bearing in mind the trade restrictions right now on Chinese goods [finance] so finally this is a great opportunity [general] I especially come here especially here I came here today to talk to the Chinese investors [cooperation] this is the time to come to our country and I from me as the Prime Minister I can assure you that the Prime Minister's Office will be dealing with all the major investors in our country [governance] and CPAC will be dealt again from the prime minister's office so to make it easy for you to invest there and to remove all hurdles that are in your way [governance] it's an exciting time in Pakistan because as we open up our country for business it is a great opportunity for people to come and invest [finance][people] and as we change the mindset in Pakistan we want businesses to come and make money [finance] we want businesses to come to China and make big profits so that the more profits you make we feel that more investors will come to Pakistan [finance] our main aim is that as we create wealth in our country we want to raise like China we won't raise the people out of poverty as China has done in the last 30 years [welfare] thank you very much [general] \"\n",

[governance] and the fact is that taliban aren't really going to have an inclusive government are they? [governance] i mean they haven't even got the non-taliban people who've helped them into power they've been excluded so far. [governance] so far they haven't got an inclusive government as we hoped they would. [governance] but then they say that this is just a transition. [action] i'm trying um that um that we should speak to them and ensure that they do have an inclusive government. [development] because there will not be any long-term sustainable peace or stability in afghanistan unless all the factions all the ethnic groups are represented. [general] but i mean there's something more important than anything to the taliban government and that's the kind of purity of their religious ideology. [welfare] i mean they're never going to allow women to go to schools or anything like that are they because it cuts across their whole notion of what a society should be? [welfare] i think they will allow women to go to schools. [general] they will allow that as far as we know they've assured us. [action] so they're doing it they say they're doing it in phases but but that remains to be seen. [action] look john where what they do from now onwards we can only hope to sort of uh persuade them and encourage them and incentivize them in that direction. [general] but you know sitting today what happens where they will go i'm afraid i don't know. [action] but this is a really good opportunity for you now to say you condemn the excesses of the taliban and that you feel that by for instance preventing women from from getting a decent education once again they're taking the wrong direction. [action] would you like to say that to us now? [welfare] john absolutely our religion if anyone has you know any idea of what our religion was it was a liberation of women. [welfare] and so whenever the idea that women should not get educated is just not islamic. [general] it might have been some rural culture in afghanistan but it is it has nothing to do with religion. [general] and and can i say what the taliban the statements they have made since they've assumed power? [governance] i mean it's very encouraging they have said they have an inclusive government. [welfare] they they have said they'll give women can uh have can work can have education. [governance] they will give amnesty to everyone the soil won't be used for terrorism by anyone. [general] you know these are encouraging statements. [action] so you're approving that the way the taliban are operating? [general] no i'm i'm approving of what they have said. [general] what happens now i'm afraid john i can't say what happens now in fact no one can tell where this where afghanistan goes from here. [welfare] but what we hope and pray that finally after 40 years the people of afghanistan will have peace and stability. [general] so when you see what's happening in afghanistan you must be pretty disgusted actually with the way that the taliban are having. [action] i think i think john what we should hope for and try for is to make them go into that direction and i in the direction in the in the statements they've made. [general] and secondly you know i our fans are very strong people. [welfare] their women are very strong i feel give them time and they will assert their rights. [general] how much time? [general] years a year two years three years at the moment. [general] but at the moment uh uh john it's just too early to say anything because it's just barely been a month after 20 years of uh civil war they have come back into power. [general] i think it's just a month two months in in a in a short period of time we will know the direction they are going. [general] by the way i think we know it now.

            "[governance] Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday claimed that the opposition's no-trust move is part of an alleged \"\"foreign-funded conspiracy\"\" hatched against his government over his refusal to have Pakistan's foreign policy be influenced from abroad. [action] He made these allegations at his party's power show titled Amr Bil Maroof (enjoin the good) and billed as a \"\"historic\"\" event at Parade Ground in Islamabad. [people] The prime minister took the podium after his fellow PTI leaders took turns addressing their party workers and supporters, who had assembled at his call ahead of a no-trust move against him in the National Assembly.

[corruption] We have been aware of this conspiracy for months. [action] We also know about those who have assembled these people (the opposition parties) but the time has changed. [general] This is not the era of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. [governance] \"\"This is the era of social media. [general] Nothing can be hidden. [action] We will not accept anyone's dictation.

[governance] We have been threatened in writing but we will not compromise on national interest.\"\" [governance] A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) He claimed to be in possession of evidence — a letter — that he said would prove his point. [governance] \"\"I am placing the case of Pakistan's independence before you. [governance] The letter I have is proof and I want to dare anyone who is doubting this letter. [general] I will invite them off the record. [general] We have to decide for how long we will have to live like this. [action] We are getting threats.

[governance] I am revealing the proofs we have. [governance] I cannot talk more in detail because I have to protect the interest of my country. [governance] I cannot talk about anything that harms my country. [action] I could have told you about it. [governance] I do not fear anyone but I care about Pakistan's interest.\"\" [people] At the onset of his speech, he thanked his supporters for gathering in the capital at his call. [people] \"\"First of all, I thank my nation. [people] The way you turned up on my call from all corners of Pakistan, I appreciate you from the bottom of my heart. [governance] I also pay tribute to my team of parliamentarians as 'you were offered money and attempts were made to bribe you but you made me happy and I am proud of you.' [welfare] \"\"I want to speak my heart out and I want you to listen to me quietly. [policy] I invited you for Amr Bil Maroof to emphasise that our Pakistan was built on the ideology of Islamic welfare state. [policy] We had to build the country on the basis of Riyasat e Madina. [governance] \"\"Shah Mehmood Qureshi had said [in his speech earlier that] there is an external interference in Pakistan ... [policy] I will speak about it later. [general] [First], you must understand that we cannot become a nation until we stand by our actual ideology. [general] \"\"I want to clarify that I also did not know the ideology of Pakistan for quite some time. [general] I left for abroad at the age of 18. [general] As I began to understand the religion, I noticed that the orders of Allah to the Holy Prophet (PBUH) were implemented more in the West. [welfare] \"\"In Britain, free medical treatment, free education, unemployment benefits, and free legal aid is given to the people. [welfare] Our Prophet had created Riysat-e-Madina where the state had taken responsibility of its people.\"\" [welfare] The prime minister recalled what he said were his government's measures to alleviate the burden on the public. [finance] \"\"We are providing loans to families for housing, technical education and small businesses.

[finance] I promise I will spend more money on my people as our government collects more capital in taxes.\"\" [corruption] The prime minister linked his crusade against corruption with the teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). [corruption] \"\"Our Prophet had also emphasised for the supremacy of law. [corruption] I don't give them NRO because my Prophet had explained that nations get destroyed when you punish the poor and exempt the rich. [corruption] \"\"Poor countries are backward because the law there fails to catch the rich who are involved in white collar crimes. [corruption] They transfer stolen and looted money to offshore accounts. [corruption] Small thieves do not destroy a country like the way big thieves do.\"\" [corruption] \"\"These 'three stooges' are looting the country for years and all this drama is being done to have Imran Khan surrender like Musharraf. [corruption] They are trying to blackmail the government.

[action] PM Imran explained the reason why today's gathering was named Amr Bil Maroof. [general] \"\"The meaning of Amr Bil Maroof is that a nation is bound to wage jihad against the evil and support the good. [general] In Britain, two million people took to the streets during Iraq war. [general] That was Amr Bil Maroof and this is what alive nations look like. [action] \"\"I called you here because attempts are being made to bribe people. [corruption] They decided to dislodge our government by claiming that Pakistan is being destroyed. [policy] I challenge that no government gave a performance like we did in our three and a half years.\"\" [policy] The premier listed a series of policy decisions taken by his government which he said benefited the country greatly and would continue to do so in future. [action] \"\"Covid erupted that led to closure of the world but I did not shut my country and faced criticism. [policy] I can proudly say that Pakistan's steps were acknowledged by the world as they helped save the economy,\"\" he said. [finance] \"\"World Bank recently released a report, which said Pakistan is the country where poverty is minimal. [finance] Later, our growth rate was more than 6 per cent. [finance] It stunned the opposition and the world. [finance] \"\"Our exports reached a historic high. [finance] We collected unprecedented tax. [finance] We gave incentives to overseas Pakistanis and received record remittances. [finance] We formed an ease-of-business model for the construction sector that led to the growth of 30 other allied industries. [finance] \"\"We saw record crops. [finance] It happened because we facilitated our farmers. [finance] We protected them. [finance] Now Pakistan's industries are growing rapidly. [finance] Textile industries are struggling to find labour because all industries are working at their full capacity. [governance] This is the first time government is supporting its industries.\"\" [action] He urged TV anchors to invite economic experts on their shows and conduct a comparison of his government's performance with the previous ones. [general] Earlier, the premier had arrived at the venue in a helicopter as footage shared on the PTI's Twitter account showed a large crowd in attendance, with buses and cars lined up outside. [action] Planning Minister Asad Umar, during his speech, said that the prime minister was \"\"waging a war\"\" against opposition leaders who were indulging in politics in Pakistan through their \"\"ill-gotten money\"\".

[governance] I want to tell the prime minister that he is the leader of the entire Muslim world and he will win this battle.\"\" [action] He said that he has advised the premier to call [fresh] elections to let the opposition know with whom people stand. [general] A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi claimed that the joint opposition had made Imran Khan an offer. [corruption] \"\"They said 'Khan, give us NRO, and we will retract the no-confidence movement.'\"\" [people] He said that the party supporters, by showing up today, had showed that they — Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Maulana Fazlur Rehman — won't get an NRO. [governance] Qureshi said that, as the foreign minister, he knows a lot of \"\"secrets\"\" which he has communicated to the prime minister. [governance] \"\"I have done my job, it is now up to you.\"\" [people] He said that for the second time, the people of Pakistan have expressed their support for Imran Khan.

[action] \"\"I hope that you will stand with Imran Khan till the day he breathes his last.\"\" [policy] Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi explained to the crowd the reasons behind the opposition's no-confidence motion. [policy] \"\"Why did these people bring the motion? [governance] I will tell you today,\"\" he said. [finance] \"\"Because, during Imran Khan's tenure, Pakistan broke all records of tax collection ... [policy] because Imran Khan is finally getting us out of FATF ... [governance] because Imran Khan made Kashmir a national issue... [general] because Imran Khan, who is an honorable man, said 'absolutely not'.\"\" [general] Ahead of the gathering, PTI supporters began descending in the capital as the party prepared to make its Amr Bil Maroof (enjoin the good) public meeting a bigger success than tit-for-tat rallies being led by opposition parties. [general] When Murad Saeed, federal minister for communications and postal services, took the stage, he made PTI supporters make a promise. [action] \"\"Pakistanis, let's take an oath today,\"\" he said, urging the crowd to repeat after him. [action] \"\"We promise that we will never compromise on the nation's honour, respect and integrity. [action] And we will fight all the internal and external threats [to Pakistan] with Prime Minister Imran Khan.\"\" [people] Saeed said that the rally's participants, by attending the rally, have not just given a message to the opposition but also to the foreign powers that they're standing with Imran Khan. [people] In her speech at the rally, Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination Fahmida Mirza confirmed that her party, the Grand Democratic Alliance, stands with the PTI government. [establishment] \"\"GDA is the party that always stands for its values,\"\" she said. [establishment] \"\"It stood with the government back then... and it will do so today.\"\" [governance] She stressed that if the defection of the National Assembly members is not stopped today, it will derail the system in the upcoming years. [governance] \"\"I am standing on the values that the Parliament should be strengthened and this 'lotacracy' should end,\"\" Mirza said. [general] In an audio message released on Twitter early today, PM Imran said that today's rally was not just PTI's war but belonged to the entire nation. [action] \"\"This is a battle for the future of Pakistan.\"\" [action] The premier urged supporters to reach the venue early as there were fears of blockades. [general] \"\"I'm scared you may not be able to reach on time because of this. [general] \"\"God willing, we will make history in Pakistan today,\"\" he added. [governance] Meanwhile, federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhary said that a \"\"brave nation needed a brave leader\"\", adding that PM Imran would never let the nation bow down. [action] In a video message, he urged citizens to attend the \"\"historic rally\"\". [governance] Islamabad police also provided directions for participants making their way to the venue. [governance] The Islamabad deputy commissioner added that all roads were open in Islamabad while entry and exit points were clear. [governance] \"\"Only Srinagar Highway is closed at H-9 area but alternate routes are open,\"\" he said. [governance] Social media was abuzz in anticipation of the prime minister's rally, with supporters sharing images and videos of them making their way to Islamabad. [action] A PTI Sindh caravan, led by Opposition Leader in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, had reached Islamabad on Saturday. [action] The caravan had started its journey from Karachi on Friday. [action] Additionally, the party said that a train — carrying supporters from Karachi — had reached Lahore on Sunday morning. [action] Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood, too, led a \"\"large rally\"\" from Lahore, which is on its way to the capital. [action] \"\"Other PTI caravans are on their way from across the country to participate in the historic public meeting,\"\" PTI Senator Faisal Javed said. [action] PTI added that caravans — being led by federal ministers and local PTI leaders — from Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan had also left for the rally. [governance] The information minister said that Pakistan's media fraternity and more than 43 representatives from international media organisations had gathered at Parade Ground to cover the rally. [governance] He directed PTI workers to facilitate media workers, saying: \"\"The world will see this historic rally through the eye of the media.\"\" [governance] On Saturday, a PTI spokesperson announced that the media professionals would not be allowed to use professional cameras to record the event as “cameras pose security risk”. [governance] This led to organisers and media crew exchanging arguments after the latter were told that cameras belonging to private TV channels would not be allowed due to the “security protocol” of the prime minister but they would be allowed to use their mobile phones for footage and photos. [governance] Separately, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid warned the JUI-F against creating unrest in the capital. [law and order] He also told the opposition that PM Imran would \"\"play until the last ball and the last over\"\". [governance] Speaking to the media in Islamabad, the minister said that the PML-N had been given permission for staging a rally on March 28 (tomorrow), predicting that voting on the no-trust move would be conducted by April 4. [law and order] Rashid also informed the nation that the interior ministry's command and control centre was operational round the clock, adding that he was personally monitoring it. [law and order] He stated that any incident could be reported on 0519206660 and 0519218594. [law and order] \"\"All of Islamabad is open. [law and order] Don't go off of rumours.\"\" [law and order] He also revealed that the prime minister wished to address the rally around 5pm, despite the large number of people that were still en route to the capital. [general] \"\"Even though the political committee said to delay [the speech], he wants to do it earlier during the day time,\"\" he said, urging citizens to make haste in reaching Parade Ground. [law and order] In case there are obstacles, we have approximately 15,000 security personnel to maintain law and order, he said. [law and order] Addressing the JUI-F protesters, the minister said that the Islamabad High Court chief justice had issued directives for keeping Srinagar Highway open. [law and order] \"\"If you come and resort to violence, then the law will be enforced according to the chief justice's orders whatever the result may be.\"\" [law and order] He said that the party had a right to stage a rally, but warned that the capital administration would take action against them if they resorted to violence. [law and order] \"\"I want to say this to JUI-F specifically: Srinagar Highway should be kept open. [law and order] Stay within your area. [law and order] The time allotted to you is up.

            "\n",
            "[general]  Thank You Prime Minister thank you for a very rich view of the challenges you're facing in the approach that you're taking. [governance] I wanted to start you you gave us a taste of your kneading yesterday with President Trump and in the past you've spoken also about your commitment to take a different approach to us-pakistan relations than previous Pakistan leaders. [policy] I'm curious if you wanted to say a bit more about what is the difference with your approach and how's that resonating during this visit in Washington and how do you see the future between US and Pakistan. [general] Incidentally I always felt that the relationship between Pakistan in the United States was never was ever multi-pronged it was basically a transactional relationship supported through the 80s. [action] Pakistan was fighting the jihad against the Soviets and so the U.S. was helping Pakistan providing aid and Pakistan was you know the various groups created in Pakistan were then conducting attacks inside Afghanistan against the Soviets. [action] The moment that jihad ended the US backed up and left and not only did they leave Pakistan was slapped with Pressler sanctions. [welfare] So Pakistan then was there for four million refugees a number of militant groups which had been created to fight the Soviets all dressed up and over to go. [general] We had  heroin the drugs that were used to at some point to pay for the fighting in Afghanistan. [corruption] So Pakistan then first time we had the sectarian attacks and by sectarian militant groups which were first time we heard of sectarian attacks inside Pakistan. [general] Then comes 9/11 and Pakistan again joins the U.S. I was then I only had one seat in parliament at the time and I remember when General Musharraf was consulting all of us that the U.S. wants us to join them in the war. [policy] I have posted I thought Pakistan should stay neutral and I'll tell you why I thought by the Sun should stay neutral we had created these jihadi groups in the 80s. [general] We had indoctrinated them in the idea of jihad that foreign occupation in Afghanistan it was a religious duty to fight them. [corruption] So all these groups including al-Qaeda arrived in Pakistan. [general] Now comes 9/11 then the U.S. at weights of our Astana and now we are trying to tell these same groups who had close links with the Pakistan Army because they were created by the Pakistan Army now we are telling them that no it's because the good guys are there is no longer jihad. [action] Now obviously a lot of them turned against the Pakistan Army because Pakistan army was then trying to neutralize them. [general] So what we went through and I just briefly mentioned earlier it was the worst time in our history. [army] These groups turned against the Pakistan Army and the state of Pakistan and not only that there were linkages between clearly there were linkages between these groups and the Pakistani security forces because they had created them. [law and order] So we had insider attacks we had I mean the GHQ was attacked generals were killed I had quarters were attacked. [army] The army at one point the army could not go into the cities in military clothes or with military cars it was that bad at one point. [governance] And then of course the second thing was the tribal areas we should never have sent army into the tribal areas because the tribal area but capita was the most weaponized area in the world. [general] For people who don't know tribal area is the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan it was always an autonomous area the British never occupied it during their rule since the 1890s. [governance] So it was an autonomous area it if it ran by its own rules. [action] So in 2004 under pressure from the United States Pakistan army went into the tribal areas to flush out al-Qaeda. [general] Now what happened was the bend after Tora Bora in Afghanistan a few of the al-Qaeda moved into our tribal areas which were semi-autonomous. [action] So when they sent the army in you know armies are not meant to go into civilian areas. [law and order] Whenever you send army into civilian areas you can ensure that there will be human rights abuses there will be collateral damage there will be people with their innocent people killed because there is no army there this is well as operating from village from villages. [welfare] So you know the collateral damage created what became is the Pakistani Taliban there was no Pakistani Taliban. [welfare] So we then had a heroes the people of tribal areas suffered one point there were these militants the other side was the Pakistan Army half of the tribal area was then internally displaced. [development] The damage we still haven't the amount of damage done in the tribal area we haven't got the resources to do to compensate them. [general] So basically the country went through him in my opinion we should have stayed neutral that worthy we would have had control over these militant groups and we could have known time neutralized them. [policy] But because we became a part of the US war they turned against Pakistan also. [general] Now what I feel there was a watershed in Pakistan in participating politics in 2014 the TTP the Pakistani Taliban slaughtered 150 school children in what was called the APS the army public school. [action] There was a reaction within Pakistan all the political parties then signed a paper called the National Action Plan and we all decided after that that we will not allow any militant groups to operate inside Pakistan until we came into power. [governance] If the government's did not have the political will because there when you talk about the militant groups they still have about thirty to forty thousand form people who have been trained and in some sort of a theater of airport either in a forest on may be in Kashmir. [action] So we were the first government who has now started disarming all the militant groups this is the first time it is acting. [action] We have we have taken over their Institute their seminaries we are now we've got administrators there. [policy] So it is the first time in Pakistan that we have decided there will be law our militias inside our country which which relates to the next question I want to ask you that's been in the news a lot it's clearly a significant element in us Pakistan relationships and that's what you referred to as well the ongoing Afghan peace process and the possibilities that we might actually have some breakthroughs. [cooperation] Is in building on what you just said our is the Pakistan government able and willing to make the commitment to really help move these dialogues forward especially in the event that the Taliban and Afghan government unable to get a meeting organized? [general] Is just for people's benefit the affair amongst the Pakistan military establishment was always that there would be a two-front situation. [governance] So there would be you know these two front which is India and then everyoneís Khan was also in the Indian Sapir of influence then Pakistan would be sandwiched between these two and so this was always the worry about the Pakistan military of establishment. [policy] And which is why they wanted what was called the strategic gift but this has changed today there is no concept in Pakistan of strategic depth because we feel that by interfering in Afghanistan in order to secure the strategic depth we have actually done a lot of damage to our own country. [general] And for no rhyme or reason we have become partisan in Afghanistan's internal affairs now and I speak for Pakistan army because you know normally there was that you know there's a Pakistan Army's this independent entity and you know the government's have no control over it. [governance] I can sit here and tell you that I speak as I speak the Pakistan Army is exactly behind the government's program whatever our policies from day one we were I have peace with India they were behind when I decided to release the Indian pilot who had been shot down in Pakistan. [cooperation] The army was right behind me so I speak to the wheat today speak as you know that there is no difference between the policies of the Pakistan security forces or the partisans government and we believe that we should not ever interfere in the internal affairs of a forest and let the upon to decide what they want what sort of government they want and we should facilitate the peace process. [policy] So this is the big difference now we're all on the same page and fortunately not the United States on the same page too because you know after you know the Einstein's definition of Merit is trying to do the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. [general] 1719 years of conflict and if they had gone thank God for President Trump I mean it this could have gone for other than another 19 years allotted result. [policy] But it sounds like you're willing to use your leverage with the Taliban to facilitate the peace process in future a big a big welcome change. [cooperation] Gonna bond delegation wanted to briefly a few months back and the one and when I became the Prime Minister and it's because I always maintained that there was no military solution while everyone else and private funds political spectrum kept sort of a dream that there was some military solution. [policy] So because of that you know I had a certain amount of credibility amongst them they wanted to meet me but the affluent government at that point did not want me to meet them. [cooperation] So I did not meet them but now when I go back after meeting President Trump and also I've spoken to President honey now I will meet the Taliban and I will try my best to get them to talk to the foreign government and so that then the election and Afghanistan must be an inclusive election where the Taliban are also participate in it. [welfare] I want to ask something that's very important to people here and that is the view that in Pakistan censorship and harassment of the press of activists and dissenting voices of women is on the rise and you just spoke very eloquently about a new Pakistan talked about the inequalities that have plagued the economy. [governance] And I'm curious what what are your thoughts and commitments about also protecting the pluralism and the freedom of speech and of the media that's so important to a democratic Pakistan. [governance] But just let me say one thing my government and time will prove this will be the most inclusive government in Pakistan ever. [welfare] We will try we have already now ensured full protection for our minorities we have I won't go into detail but there's one element where we still have a problem but what we have done no government has done before. [welfare] And I'll give you an example that there was this case of Archaea Bibi she was this Christian woman who was jailed and no no judge would try them because of blasphemy and because of the strength of one particular group which which had the previous government I was held hostage by the group they came in and they literally blocked the roads and people were scared of that group. [governance] So when the judgement was given to free her by the supreme court the same group then threatened they were they came out on the streets they were writing for two days and you know the stage was endorsed it for two days. [governance] But this is the first government that next opportune moment actually took them out to put them in jails we just completely and hacia baby words and safely she came out and then she wanted to leave the country and we helped her. [welfare] So all I'm saying is that this government will you will see that it will treat its minorities as equal citizens. [welfare] I just there's just one thing I don't go into detail but there's one aspect I can't talk about it but we have still a problem I'm I'm not saying we've completely controlled the situation but you will see that this is not out of worry about what the out of the Western world or any other people say about us. [general] It's because of out of our conviction that our minority is according to our religion according to our Constitution I equal citizens. [general] Now the media you know I have I'm in my life I went to university in England and I spent about 18 summers of my life in England and I've seen the British media very open very very free media the Pakistan media in my opinion is even freer than the British media. [general] There is there is the media in Pakistan I mean is not just free but sometimes out of control. [general] I can tell you that in Britain in Britain no media would have come published things like or said on television things like the Pakistan media has that I can tell you since I've read and follow. [general] I mean imagined I don't even think in America this would be allowed even though the media has a love-hate relationship with President Trump more heads and love sometimes. [general] But imagine that against a prime minister and this man stepped on television and says that I can tell you that he is getting divorced tomorrow and so if there were some truth to that you know you would okay if you had some knowledge but there's only me and my wife living together where did he get this information from. [general] But this kind of thing I mean I in the olden days I can tell you that this guy would have been beaten up the wash leaves time give the previous prime minister he had gel is beaten off our scissors ie people were petrified of him. [general] You would just people would disappear in my time I tried I built the legal channels I reported it to the media you know I went into the court all I'm saying is that what the media and Pakistan is you will not find a media like that. [general] And I remember the previous ambassador to to Pakistan him saying that the media was out of control so what we need is to control the media and not through the government but through media watchdog. [general] At the moment I mean this is two or three things the media did one is that this started reporting wrongly that the IMF had said that the rupee would fall you know to to a number they quoted they almost there was a run on the rupee. [finance] I mean who would do that first you are fighting in a biggest economic crisis in your history second you have media coming up with this false news about causing a run on the rupee or the finance ministers chain and so on. [finance] So what I'm saying I feel very strongly that we will strengthen the media watchdog it is not censorship we will strengthen the media watchdog but there are 70 channels or 80 channels in Pakistan would only three channels reported that there was therefore having some problems. [general] So we have a whole afternoons worth of questions for you but before I go I just need to ask you one last question it's very important for us I please mandate and that is the number of international that are raising concern about the increased difficulty of working in Pakistan. [general] And you know fully understanding that the government has a role in registering these groups and in regulating the space many of them are complaining of a very arbitrary process that ultimately is hampering very genuine efforts to work in partnership with Pakistani organizations and the government. [governance] And examples of forced expulsion is your government committed to addressing this issue it's been going on since before you took often and I think there are hopes that you might be able to do something to make it a more transparent and fair process absolutely. [governance] The foreign minister has been dealing with this issue and we have tried to work out to have these guidelines for btr-4 NGOs. [governance] I mean I run the biggest more two biggest NGOs in Pakistan which is the cancer hospital and the university but we did have problem that I can just frankly tell you the reason why these restrictions came there was an issue of Shakil Afridi was working for a or a NGO attacked the doctor and the NGO was water over to save the children children sister. [governance] So after that the there the result was that the extremist militants started targeting NGOs specifically we had one of our biggest problem was that the polio workers were being targeted so many of the polio workers were shot after that. [governance] So after that there we are trying to streamline it you know make sure that this doesn't happen again because that affected the activities of other NGOs. [governance] In fact one of the NGOs gave a statement condemning that NGOs should not be allowed for Espen idea or that sort of tech stuff but we already looking at it but there were three German NGOs which had left Pakistan but after being cleared they've come back and and we're looking at a case to case basis. [general] I know there'd be great appreciation for that so number of questions none of them small hears from Twitter any progress on restarting the u.s. security assistance some of these we can make rather short no no I've never asked for assistance. [policy] Okay Arthur asked for understanding not assistance also from Twitter what's an ideal Kashmiri solution from the Pakistan perspective and one that you believe the Pakistan people will accept. [policy] I think it should not be the Pakistani people anymore it should be what the people of Kashmir world and and that really is the only solution what do the people of Kashmir and and attract and presumably a process that surfaces that and enabled it to take hold due to a bill. [policy] I'm torn because we had three foreign ministers who were in other parties who joined us one of them of course is shaman with Qureshi and two of them told me that actually they came pretty close in the time of General Musharraf and when mr. Watts I was the Prime Minister of India apparently they came pretty close there was some sort of convergence on on a phased louboutin Kashmiri awnser various steps to be taken and over a period of time some sort of a referendum. [policy] Anyway but I don't want to say anything right now because it's a delicate issue but there is a solution and the solution has to be with the will of the people of Kashmir. [general] So you covered this but I see about four questions going back to this issue of media censorship and here's one particularly that talks about TV channels are taken off journalists are facing threats the party's official Twitter routinely cautions journalists of committing treason. [governance] So in a country where many journalists have been killed do you think such rhetoric will enable and incite violence and directly affect the freedom of the press judo an NT. [general] I'm probably one of the biggest beneficiaries of the media when we had free media I gained the most because I was until then until 2001 there was only one television and that was the national television B TV which was totally a government controlled television. [general] So with the independent channels coming in I became the biggest beneficiary because we didn't have any money I mean my party was pretty small for a long time so I was able to go on television give my point of view and that's how my party gained because I was I had a way of conveying my manifesto my how I would deal with the various issues. [general] So there is no question and Pakistan of ever clamping down on the media I can just tell you that there is no question. [general] What is what happens is sometimes and I will you know know that you keep asking you were stuck on media so I'll just go I will just tell you a bit of truth about the media you know there is as equal knew once famously remarked what he what was sometimes called freedom of speech by the media of freedom of expression is sometimes the freedom of the owners of the media channels to conduct whatever they want to do. [general] So in Pakistan what we've had we had the situation where here we were fighting I don't know how many of you know of the Panama papers well the Panama revolutions so this Panama revelations came about like the WikiLeaks and our prime ministers we discovered that he had these luxury apartments in London most expensive Mayfair he had these four luxury apartments. [corruption] So like a opposition like in anywhere in the democracy we asked him where did you get the money to buy these flats and then started this whole movement to get into and so these were these questions now there was a court case in the end and in the court he was convicted. [corruption] But do you know they were there was a media channel one of the most powerful media channels they did everything to protect him now this is not what a media is supposed to do. [general] The media did everything they covered up for him not just protecting him I who was asking my democratic right a question to are asking trouble waiting to get the money I was attacked but for the tax. [general] I mean the sort of attacks I face no politically right Alec no political leader would have gone through the sort of person attacks they went because you know they could attack me on my arm or on integrity so they went on these person attacks so this is not normal for media to do this. [general] Media is not supposed to do this media is supposed to be a watchdog to bring out you know play the role of an opposition but they're not about personal tax and try to blackmail you. [general] We just ever are not another case right now there is a judge who convicted the previous prime minister not this charge the opposition's brought out a videos blackmail again about him with some compromising with you with some woman. [general] The broad this happens in Italian mafias it doesn't have state democracies. [general] So I mean you know you I firmly believe that we eventually will have to move where the media orders will have to disclose their source of welcome you know just like anyone else they'll have to stay how much text to the pair what is the source of income even if you ask them how much tax you paid some of these videos said this is a freedom it's against freedom of expression. [general] So looking at it from that perspective versus a censorship regime but more of a transparency effort is the focus and then accountable media media should also be accountable either you can't have a media set of protecting criminals in a society. [general] Okay we're going to move it the conversation here there are a number of questions about Afghanistan I think you've covered that but here's one specifically asking how do you view the peace talk the peace talks about Afghanistan hosted by both Russia and News Pakistan. [cooperation] You don't we should really get all the neighbors of Afghanistan involved with the peace talks because this is it should be the interest Pakistan the United States and Afghanistan these three countries today are the most interested in having peace in Afghanistan. [cooperation] But not all neighbors are interested in peace in Afghanistan because you know for various reasons people have their other countries have their own agendas. [cooperation] So I firmly believe that the US should try and cop as many countries as possible because there will be people who will be trying to you know put a spanner in the works and so if the neighbors are all involved there is a much better chance of for the dogs going smoothly. [cooperation] And speaking of neighbors there's a question saying what and you mentioned this in Europe any remarks what what role can Pakistan play in easing the rising tensions with Iran and a number of other countries including the United States without damaging some of your other relationships how are you thinking about that? [cooperation] You see Pakistan is you know we're really indebted to Saudi Arabia we indebted to je because the way they came forward you know when we were confronted with this when we took over government we only had two weeks of foreign exchange reserves so we were staring at a default and these countries came forward to help us and so we are really indebted to them. [finance] But my worry about Iran is I really I think I am not sure whether all the countries realize the gravity of the situation if there is a conflict with Iran people don't understand you know this is not going to be the same as Iraq this could be much much much worse it will have great consequences for Pakistan adverse consequences for our for our country. [general] It could unleash terrorism which would which people would forget al Qaeda and those types because the Iranian you know the the Shia element in Islam is very cohesive they have a much greater sense of martyrdom than the Sunni Muslims. [general] You know if the battle might be quite short if you know if if if it goes ahead and you know bombing airfields and so on but the consequence is after that my worry is that not many people fully understand it and I would strongly urge that there should not be this contract should not they should not be another military service situation. [general] Pakistan has already suffered I said as what we went through these last 15 years and last thing we want is another contract on our borders and you know we would do anything I mean if any role Pakistan can play in this we have already had suggested this to Iran until recently Iran was willing but then when somehow I felt that Iran is getting very desperate and I do not think they should be pushed into a situation where where this leads to a conflict. [general] Another question via Twitter what are some of the concrete steps your government is taking to ensure that the military operates under civilian leadership something you alluded to in your earlier comments? [governance] You see in Pakistan we had three martial laws and the last one was General Musharraf. [governance] I think General Musharraf martial law was a watershed in Pakistan in the sense that there was a opinion across the board that when you have bagged democracy the answer is not to have a military government because the military government comes in it's like curing cancer with disprin for while you feel good because they are organized it's an organized institution but eventually if you know you you you end up eating even a worse situation because then the McChrystal's democracy starts all over again. [governance] And what we need in Pakistan now is an extended run of democracy and I do I really do believe that the the democratic evolution of the country has reached a point where now we will go towards further democracy. [governance] I mean us winning the election is you know who would have thought we would have won an election against these but how many times in a two-party system as a third party's broken through it's unheard of. [general] I mean nowhere in the world does a third party break through we broke through because of social media we actually despite the official media sort of not giving us that sort of coverage although pinon polls were that we would not make it but it was the social media and the young people who came out and and made us defeat the two established parties. [general] And I think the process will keep going on I think that in Pakistan people have tasted freedom they understand you know the power of the board in fact social media has actually Democrats the whole world everyone now has you know they can they have Twitter they get everyone can participate. [general] How we're getting questions well I have two related questions on that I think build on the vision that you just articulated and the first is what will the government do to address closing space for civil society and how does that fit into your vision? [governance] And closing space for civil society and and activist either this to the house house the government I think it looks goes it's truthful. [general] So there's another question about Google Ayush mail and other activists your total PTM PTM comm signals there I think they're saying it's a broader civil society questions that it's actually it's related to feet here. [general] Look you know all these years I kept saying you know when Pakistan I stood up in the National Assembly in our Parliament in 2004 I objected to the Pakistan Army going being said into our tribal areas. [governance] No one understood the tribal area the only reason I understood the tribal areas is because some thirty years back I wrote a book on the tribal areas I did a travel book I went all over and I stuff I am so I understood the tribal areas. [general] But as I said it is one of the most weaponized per capita area in the world it's a most devolved democracy it's every villages in it it is an independent entity and so and they have they have never allowed outside interference to come into the tribal areas. [general] So when Pakistan Army was being tented in 2004 I kept I stood in that Parliament tried to explain to them that the greatest number of losses when the British were ruling India they suffered the greatest number of losses in Waziristan which is tribal area so we should never have sent army there. [general] Whenever you send an army into civilian areas they are massive collateral damage and massive casualties and and destruction. [general] So all the time when I was speaking out against this I was being called Taliban hon I was being called for terrorists General Musharraf I remember in a meeting said that I am a terrorist without a beard. [general] And so once this whole thing was over this young pistol movement started and this patrol movement was correct what they were saying the area was devastated the people of the tribal areas I mean how them were internally displaced the shops were gone the most of them relied on livestock livestock disappeared the whole area was as it is tribal areas before 2001 75% of the people were under the poverty line so after this military action they even went further down. [welfare] So we had this young movement and and movement stemming out of anger and they of course they'd blame the Pakistan Army for for for all the devastation there. [general] And we've just had elections in the tribal area now we just have first time in Pakistan's history the tribal area has been assimilated but boxing for a province and first time we've had election. [general] I am very pleased to say that PTI won the election but we have now injected the greatest amount of money in the tribal areas to develop it never has so much money being allocated for development there. [development] But you know there's the reason why they were problems was the the PTM leadership started attacking the army and they kept attacking the army and the last thing happened was that they actually civilians charged an army post there were few people killed and that's why there were restrictions but now it's settling down because we've had a peaceful elections in the tribal areas. [general] So I think we will now move on I think the question was probably triggered a bit by the New York Times article about the harassment and arrests of this ghoul Ollie Ishmael family and friends. [general] I wish that they would the New York Times would also take to the other point of view and now I'm sounding like president from. [general] So we have time for just a couple more questions the US have been asking Pakistan to do more in the context of terrorism it relates a little bit to what you're saying they particularly were asking Pakistan to do more in the context of Jem and after the arrest of Hafiz Saeed is visit will he be stay in custody this time or will be here loud to go up again now you ask but we want an independent justice system and you want me to protect what the justice system will do. [law and order] Look let me just say I repeat one two again it is in the interest of Pakistan that we do not allow any armed militias in our country. [law and order] We have suffered the country has suffered sectarian attacks we have had the worst situation it has affected our investment Pakistan has not yet it has destabilized us this whole thing well Varma this what happened in February last year it was clearly an indigenous thing it was a Kashmiri boy radicalized by the brutality of the security forces he blew himself up but because this group claimed responsibility which was all which was in India as well - and what was operating in India but Pakistan sadly came to the limelight. [general] So even before this had happened we had already decided that we would disarm all militant groups in Pakistan and it is in Pakistan census I repeat it's an iron fist because the country has had enough of militant groups. [law and order] You know we had ethnic groups militant groups we had in Balochistan we still have militant groups operating we had these various religious groups so there is a decision now and by the way it is across the party every political party has signed the National Action Plan but Pakistan is now determined and you know normally it was said that the security forces patronized the groups the security forces we would not be disarming them at the security forces were not standing behind us you cannot disarm because the police is incapable of disarming these groups they are trained I mean they have these people have experience of fighting in Afghanistan some in Kashmir the police cannot go after them. [law and order] So it's the army that is helping us disarm all militant groups in our country. [army] Mr. Prime Minister you have been very generous with your time we have so many more questions that we won't be able to get to thank you everybody for your questions but before we close I want to ask one last question which is this is your first visit here as Prime Minister we have a very distinguished audience here of policy makers people in and out of government people who care deeply about the us-pakistan relationship what final message would you like to leave as a closing thought for everyone. [cooperation] I would like to my message from my trip first trip as the prime minister to the US I would like to have a relationship mutual between the two countries a mutual trust. [cooperation] I would like to have a relationship as equals of friendship not as it has been before and where Pakistan has served in you know it's like Pakistan wanting hate from the US and then as parade Pakistan is expected to do certain things. [cooperation] The reason why I'm happy leaving the US this time it's because we have a relationship now based on a mutual interest which is peace in Afghanistan and you know someone asked that up will you get this one I hate the idea that we would be asking for funds not viewers for anyone because this is aid has been one of the biggest pluses for my country. [finance] What is has done and what it has done is it has created the dependency syndrome we have become you know I I when I went on my first trip to Saudi Arabia I came back what have you got from there as if I'd gone there to beg for money and I think it's humiliating for a country country's rise because of self-respect and self-esteem no country's rise by begging boring for money. [finance] So my relationship with us would be I would like a relationship with a dignified relationship with the US where never again should we ever have this that humiliating face I can tell you as a Pakistani never did I feel more humiliated while Osama bin Laden was taken out in Pakistan by the US troops. [general] Never did I feel more humiliated because here was a country which was supposed to be an ally and our and I did not trust us so as a Pakistani it was for every Pakistani it was humiliating we never want to be in that same position again we want to have a relationship of friendship and it doesn't matter you know friend can be rich and the other care can not be so rich but so what you give me it's it's about a dignified relationship and that's what I hope. [cooperation]  They could present you with a small token of our appreciation for your visit or here invite you to come back and wish you all the best please join me in thanking the Prime Minister.

            "[army] \"\"There are constant attacks on our soldiers; they are sacrificing their lives every day,\"\" he said, noting that 20 security personnel were martyred in two attacks on Thursday.  \n",
            "[people] \"\"Why are they sacrificing their lives? For us; for the country. And this jackal (geedar) who ran with his tail between his legs used such language for the army chief and DG ISI,\"\" he added, referring to Nawaz.  \n",
            "[governance] While addressing the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) rally via video link from London, Nawaz on Friday had accused the security establishment of being behind his ouster as prime minister and of \"\"bringing Imran Khan into power\"\".  \n",
            "[governance] He named Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, alleging that they were responsible for making a \"\"state above the state\"\" and for the presence of \"\"two governments\"\" in the country, among other things.  \n",
            "[governance] Recalling the origins of Nawaz's political career, Prime Minister Imran said he had first become a minister through the patronage of Gen (retd) Ghulam Jilani and reached chief ministership by \"\"polishing the boots of Gen Ziaul Haq\"\".  \n",
            "[corruption] He also accused the PML-N leader of having received \"\"crores of rupees from the Mehran Bank to fight elections against the PPP\"\", saying the ISI chief at the time had submitted a report in this regard to the Supreme Court.  \n",
            "[law and order] \"\"It is unfortunate that our country's courts have always helped him. This is the man who put [PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali] Zardari in jail twice. It was Zardari who instituted the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case against him, not Gen [Qamar Javed] Bajwa.\"\"  \n",
            "[corruption] The premier cited several books written by Western authors which he said detailed Nawaz and Zardari's alleged corruption during their first stints in power.  \n",

            "[governance] \"\"Why doesn't he say the same about me? Because I showed his true extremist picture to the world,\"\" he added.  \n",
            "[general] Before his address took on a more serious tone, Prime Minister Imran showed a video clip, purportedly 11 years old, in which he had \"\"predicted\"\" the coming together of the opposition to protect their alleged corruption and even displayed a combination image of Nawaz before and after he left for London for medical treatment, suggesting that the PML-N leader had gotten better by just leaving the country.  \n",
            "[people] Imran said he would not comment on the speeches done by PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz and PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, referring to them as \"\"kids\"\" who were raised on their fathers' \"\"haraam (prohibited) earnings\"\".  \n",
            "[governance] The premier said Indian newspapers were praising Nawaz for espousing democracy but questioned whether they were unaware that \"\"Ziaul Haq gave him a pacifier and this is the Nawaz Sharif who bought the judiciary\"\".  \n",
            "[law and order] \"\"He is only with the judiciary as long as it is with him.

            "[governance] He challenged the opposition's claim of rigging in the 2018 elections, saying less petitions were filed to challenge the vote count in the 2018 polls than in 2013.  \n",
            "[finance] The prime minister said the government had \"\"documentary evidence\"\" that the PML-N had spent Rs2.5 billion from state funds to win the by-election in Lahore's NA-120 constituency, adding that the case had been forwarded to the National Accountability Bureau.  \n",
            "[action] \"\"The opposition has only seen one Imran Khan ... The Imran Khan they will now see will be different,\"\" he said, adding that \"\"no dacoit will be given a production order of any sort.\"\"  \n",

            "[governance] Prime Minister Imran further said opposition members will \"\"no longer be kept in VIP jails\"\" and will be sent to ordinary prisons.  \n",
            "[action] He added that although NAB and the judiciary are independent, he will \"\"personally prepare\"\" the institutions under him to catch every person who has looted money and taken it abroad.  \n",
            "[governance] Once again addressing the courts, the premier said Nawaz was trying to \"\"create chaos\"\" within the judiciary and the army and \"\"appealing to the Israeli and Indian lobby in the US\"\".  \n",
            "[governance] \"\"I know the game he is playing; I have all the intelligence. It makes no difference to me who the army chief or DG ISI is because I am not stealing any money.\"\"  \n",
            "[army] He lauded Gen Bajwa for standing with his government during \"\"the difficult period\"\", saying the army had taken a cut in the defence expenditure for two years and supported the government's foreign policy throughout.  \n",
            "[action] \"\"Nawaz Sharif, from today it will be my full effort to bring you back to this country and we will keep you in an ordinary jail, not a VIP one.\"\"  \n",
            "[finance] While addressing Corona Relief Tiger Force (CRTF) volunteers, the prime minister sought to explain the reasons for double-digit inflation in the country.  \n",
            "[finance] He said Pakistan had a record trade deficit of Rs40 billion when the PTI came into power.  \n",
            "[finance] Because of the deficit, the rupee fell sharply against the dollar which in turn made imports, such as those of food items, more expensive.  \n",
            "[finance] Additionally, he said, for two years the rain fell when wheat was set to be harvested.  \n",
            "[finance] The country needed 2.7 million tonnes of wheat but because of a deficit, its price started rising, the premier said.  \n",
            "[governance] \"\"We got to know about it late because the system for determining it was non-functional. We have now imported to compensate for the shortage. [But] the market did not know and hoarding started. It is a big curse in our country and I need you for this,\"\" he told the volunteers.  \n",
            "[action] He directed Tiger Force members \"\"not to interfere anywhere personally\"\" and only take a picture and upload that and the location where a product is being hoarded to the government's portal.  \n",
            "[governance] \"\"It is the job of the administration to take action. You have to go to shops where prices are not displayed and you have to take and send a picture. I repeat, you do not have to interfere yourselves,\"\" Imran said, adding that there was a risk some people would pose as Tiger Force members to mint money from traders.  \n",
            "[governance] The prime minister's instructions come after opposition parties and traders opposed the government move to deploy Tiger Force volunteers for checking prices of food items to help it control inflation.  \n",

            "[governance] The early signs were nonetheless encouraging.  \n",
            "[policy] The new premier promised more relevance for parliament, starting with Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), the Westminster tradition where the premier answers members of parliament each week.  \n",
            "[general] Per one such premier, Tony Blair, \"\"PMQs was the most nerve-racking, discombobulating, nail-biting, bowel-moving, terror-inspiring, courage-draining experience in my prime ministerial life, without question.\"\"  \n",

            "[governance] But the proposed PMQs were never to be, and soon enough faded out.  \n",
            "[governance] Instead, the new parliament stalled before it started, squabbling over Shehbaz Sharif’s nomination as chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), parliament’s most powerful panel — tasked with monitoring how the government spends its money.  \n",
            "[governance] To ensure balance, the PAC had been chaired by a Leader of the Opposition more or less since 2008 — Chaudhry Nisar had taken on the PPP’s spending, while Khursheed Shah watched over the PML-N’s.  \n",
            "[corruption] With Shehbaz, however, the ruling party said no: one could either fight corruption or be charged with it.  \n",

            "[governance] Other committees remained in flux, and work didn’t get done.  \n",
            "[governance] Mr Sharif’s people pointed to parliamentary convention (albeit one not strictly followed: the PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan was nominated chairman after Chaudhry Nisar’s resignation, while the PPP was still in power).  \n",
            "[governance] Eventually, the PTI caved, and Mr Sharif was appointed chairman.  \n",
            "[governance] Yet despite all the ruckus, the PAC remained nonfunctional.  \n",
            "[governance] By the time Shehbaz resigned from its chairmanship in 2019, he hadn’t presided over a meeting in nearly six months.  \n",
            "[governance] That first brawl set the tone for the rest of the parliamentary committees: the Speaker’s attempts at breaking the impasse through two new bipartisan panels — the almost identically named Parliamentary Committee on Legislative Business, and the Parliamentary Consultation Committee on Legislative Business — came to nothing.  \n",

            "[corruption] The PPP and the PML-N — the children of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the chastened heirs of General Zia — were dubbed Pakistan’s most major problem: corrupt dynasties that had grown rich and prominent and powerful, even as the country sank in their shadow.  \n",

            "[governance] There was precedent as well: though the Bhuttos and Sharifs had spent much of the ‘90s acting as each other’s jailers, they had sobered up enough after General Musharraf’s coup to hold their noses, and sign the Charter of Democracy.  \n",
            "[policy] That charter meant keeping the gloves on, and the military’s gloves at bay.  \n",
            "[policy] It also meant passing landmark laws: the Constitution saw massive changes, including the 18th and 25th Amendments.  \n",
            "[corruption] Though the relationship between the PML-N and the PPP was mostly fraught — from governor’s rule in Punjab to the arrest of Zardari crony Dr Asim — the charter lived, and parliament chugged on.  \n",
            "[corruption] To the PTI, however, this was corruption at its most entrenched.  \n",

            "[corruption] For opposition members, now facing a flood of NAB call-up notices, there was also another calculus at work: convictions or not, a crusade against the political class kept the PTI’s base happy, while also hamstringing its opponents — if the price to pay was less legislative reform, then so be it.  \n",

            "[governance] The PTI was already tied down by a thin majority in the House, and a minority in the Senate.  \n",
            "[governance] As a workaround, joint sessions were used to bulldoze dozens of bills.  \n",
            "[policy] Ordinances became the order of the day, as big-ticket reforms stalled.  \n",

            "[policy] \"\"Running the government by giving [a] share to all is not a big deal, but if you want to bring about reforms you have to have a two-thirds majority.\"\"  \n",
            "[policy] Yet this would imply that reform could only be achieved through super-majorities — something our electoral winners haven’t had for the vast majority of this country’s existence — and with no constructive role for the opposition.  \n",
            "[policy] While this chimed well with what the premier felt about his colleagues, it ended up shutting the door on major laws being passed.  \n",
            "[governance] According to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), the prime minister attended 10 per cent of the sessions in his first two-and-a-half years (his predecessor Nawaz Sharif was almost as casual, at 15pc).  \n",
            "[governance] Read: Ordinance factory.  \n",
            "[governance] In the longer term, the lack of parliamentary processes also knocked aside the fragile consensus on which the two older parties had arrived — a vote of no-confidence was neither brought against the PPP’s Yusuf Raza Gilani and Raja Parvez Ashraf, nor against the PML-N’s Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.  \n",
            "[governance] The last prime minister to face such a vote was in 2006.  \n",
            "[governance] Shaukat Aziz, the Honourable Member from Citibank, a man as divorced from the political process as the general that had parachuted him into the assembly.  \n",
            "[governance] The vote before that one had been against Benazir Bhutto in 1989, on the heels of General Zia’s eleven years.  \n",
            "[governance] Both failed.  \n",
            "[general] Then again, it was also a question of numbers.  \n",
            "[general] Neither the PPP nor the PML-N had been Hamiltonian democrats lately — long after the ink had dried on the Charter of Democracy, Asif Zardari would joke about triggering the fall of the PML-N’s government in Balochistan, while Nawaz Sharif would petition the Supreme Court in a lawyer’s black tie against Yusuf Raza Gilani during the Memogate scandal.  \n",
            "[governance] But votes of no-confidence against each other’s premiers went untried, as numbers games that had never once succeeded before.  \n",
            "[governance] Even so, Mr Khan isn't like those premiers.  \n",
            "[general] When it comes to the actual tally of seats, he is more vulnerable than most.  \n",
            "[general] Further narrowing that tally are the turncoats within, as the prime minister has found himself up against the same ‘electables’ that once claimed to have edged him to victory.  \n",
            "[general] In another life, Mr Khan had defined himself against electables — party-hopping constituency bosses that eked out victories through local influence.  \n",
            "[general] But after the bruising loss of the 2013 elections, the PTI fast shed its skin as a third-party outsider.  \n",
            "[general] On the eve of the polls five years later, Mr Khan told this paper, \"\"You contest elections to win. You don’t contest elections to be a good boy. I want to win. I am fighting elections in Pakistan, not Europe. I can’t import European politicians.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] He continued, \"\"The political class here doesn’t change that much. You can introduce new actors but you can’t change the political class wholesale. This is why I give the example of Mahathir Mohamad, who changed Malaysia with the same political class by giving them clean leadership.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] Though he needed the usual \"\"lotas\"\" to get over the finish line, reform would start as soon as he got there: \"\"It would be a compromise if I did not stick to my objectives after coming into power, and if I did not run a clean government.\"\"  \n",
            "[action] As for those that strayed, Mr Khan promised to kick them out.  \n",
            "[governance] Once in power, however, the prime minister’s cabinet resembled a Musharraf-era remix album, while Punjab was held up by the original band itself — the Chaudhrys of Gujrat.  \n",
            "[general] Though few care to remember, it was well before the Panama Papers when Mr Khan petitioned the courts seeking his rivals’ disqualification.  \n",
            "[corruption] The gents he named as respondents in 2002 weren’t the Sharif brothers; they were Messrs Shujaat Hussain and Parvez Elahi, lords of all they beheld at the time, while the PTI was a one-seat party.  \n",
            "[general] Commenting on the case, and the Chaudhrys’ rise and rise with it, the late, great columnist Ardeshir Cowasjee wrote, \"\"By the time [Zahoor Elahi’s] politically motivated murder was executed, the “joint family system” consisted of a row of seven or eight palatial mansions on millionaires’ row in Lahore, plus a large industrial empire financed by the country’s nationalised banks and the cooperative societies of Punjab.\"\"  \n",
            "[corruption] Mr Cowasjee thought to weigh in himself: \"\"According to the law, as it stands today, it appears that both the Chaudhrys fully qualify for disqualification.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] But the past is another country.  \n",
            "[general] Twenty years later, the Chaudhrys have snatched up prize after prize from their sheepish coalition partners.  \n",
            "[governance] On the basis of just five seats in the National Assembly, and ten in Punjab, they’ve landed the Speakership in Lahore, as well as two ministries in Islamabad.  \n",
            "[governance] Mr Khan’s recent wooing of Moonis Elahi, the sort of charmless dynast he otherwise decries, is a case in point.  \n",
            "[governance] Yet true to form, even as the vote of no-confidence approaches, the PML-Q has been flirting with the opposition right to the end.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"They have the required numbers,\"\" Parvez Elahi winked the other day, \"\"even more than what one can imagine.\"\"  \n",
            "[governance] He was far more critical of his coalition partner, saying \"\"the work carried out on the government's behalf never allowed it to learn things for itself.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] \"\"The child will learn to walk only when you put him down,\"\" he said metaphorically.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"Would you keep on changing nappies all his life?\"\"  \n",
            "[governance] More than ever, he seems ready to jump, and he’s been jumping for a long time.  \n",
            "[general] It was, after all, a much younger Mr Elahi that co-authored another vote of no-confidence as early as 1986 against a 37-year-old chief minister of Punjab called Mian Nawaz Sharif.  \n",
            "[governance] With the Chaudhrys' rebels closing in, Mian sahib was rescued by General Zia in the nick of time.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"When the motion was being prepared, but had not yet been moved, Zia said no conspiracy would succeed against Nawaz Sharif,\"\" Nawaz remembered later with gratitude.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"His words made those people lose hope. All their efforts ultimately went up in smoke.\"\"  \n",
            "[governance] But the Chaudhrys remained a reality.  \n",
            "[general] In the years since, the PML-Q has evolved through each stage of influence-peddling — derided as the king’s party under the generals, the party became kingmaker after aligning with the PTI.  \n",
            "[general] It’s now grasping for the kingship itself in Punjab — the office of chief minister.  \n",
            "[governance] Per the talking heads, they’ll go with whichever party — in government or outside it — hands them Lahore.  \n",
            "[general] As a visibly exasperated Sheikh Rashid said, \"\"I’m not like those people with five [seats], who commit blackmail for the province’s chief ministry.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] Be that as it may, the Sheikh of Lal Haveli only ever had one seat to put up.  \n",
            "[general] (He has since denied hitting out at the Chaudhrys.)  \n",
            "[governance] Less committed are the PTI’s other allies.  \n",
            "[general] The MQM, a career expert at extorting weak coalitions — and at extortion in general — has been exuding long, dramatic sighs for months.  \n",
            "[governance] The party with the unimprovable name, BAP, took its cue in February — it threatened to quit, while asking for more cabinet spots in the same breath — it has already begun backing out of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  \n",
            "[general] As for the GDA, the alliance of feudal lords notable only for not being the PPP, it’s been shuffling some inches closer to the treasury benches.  \n",
            "[general] Worse by some degrees is the picture presented by the PTI’s actual MNAs, many of whom arrived as part of the electables wave of 2018.  \n",
            "[general] Motivated less by reform and more by deep-fried patronage, the electables fought to win, and winning meant little without access to state resources.  \n",
            "[general] The rest was predetermined.  \n",
            "[general] As soon as the PTI started tottering, the forever-incumbents dashed for the gates.  \n",
            "[general] Some would have jumped anyway, just as they had deserted their own parties to join the tabdeeli government.  \n",
            "[general] Others were resentful from before, as when the inquiry into the sugar cartel came down hard on the party’s former financiers, and forced them to prop up a pressure group of dissidents (if for the sole purpose of keeping the FIA’s handcuffs away).  \n",
            "[general] Yet others saw themselves as the rightful heirs to Takht-e-Lahore, but had to stomach corruption cases, as well as the reign of Usman Buzdar.  \n",
            "[governance] And the choice of Mr Buzdar merits some space of its own.  \n",
            "[general] Even by Pakistan’s standards, the appointment of Usman Buzdar as the chief minister of Punjab sparked all kinds of rumours.  \n",
            "[general] As a little-known gent late of the PML-N and the PML-Q, who had joined the PTI as late as 2018’s election season, a Buzdar ministry came as a bolt from the blue.  \n",
            "[general] Once the initial shock wore off, it was whispered that he was a placeholder for when the actual chief minister emerged; or he was a consensus candidate in a badly divided party; or he was a dark horse pick that would prove all the naysayers wrong.  \n",
            "[general] When it became apparent that none of the above was true, the reality of Usman Buzdar started assuming a weight of its own.  \n",
            "[general] In time, that weight would begin pressing down on the PTI’s electoral prospects in Punjab, chip away at the party’s support from the establishment, and encourage (though not cause) the vote of no-confidence at the centre.  \n",
            "[general] Read: The problem with Buzdar.  \n",
            "[general] Over the next three years, not a single credible explanation would be advanced by the ruling party as to why this man was handed the fates of a hundred million people.  \n",
            "[general] In the first of perhaps dozens of endorsements, Mr Khan tweeted on 18 August 2018, \"\"I have done my due diligence over the past two weeks and have found him to be an honest man. He has integrity and stands by my vision and ideology of Naya Pakistan.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] There was also the common man pitch: \"\"Usman comes from one of the most backward areas of Punjab,\"\" he said, \"\"the tribal area of DG Khan Division … he understands the problems of the people of neglected areas and will be able to ensure their uplift as CM.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] Here was Wasim Akram Plus via Taunsa Sharif, a talent for the ages.  \n",
            "[general] So it was that a first-time MPA was elected chief minister, though the same could be said, perhaps, for Mian Nawaz Sharif in 1985.  \n",
            "[general] Yet it was for that same reason that Naya Punjab’s choice was so crucial — whoever was to be handed the reins to Lahore, the Sharifs’ generational stronghold, had to have brains and heart to try and tilt it away.  \n",
            "[general] But that was also a double-edged sword — for any prime minister up in the hills, a rising leader in Punjab had always been cause for the jitters.  \n",
            "[general] No one familiar with Nawaz Sharif, Parvez Elahi, Manzoor Wattoo, or Mustafa Khar would argue otherwise.  \n",
            "[general] For the past two decades, the only man Mian sahib could trust in the same post was his own brother.  \n",
            "[general] By contrast, the only government Mr Buzdar could threaten was his own.  \n",
            "[general] In the beginning though, criticism of the new chief minister seemed shallow, focusing less on any actual metrics and more on his damp persona.  \n",
            "[general] In the opposition’s hands, Mr Buzdar was painted as a sack of potatoes turned sentient.  \n",
            "[general] PTI voices shrugged this off — there was a class element to the snobbery.  \n",
            "[general] Or they pointed to his predecessor, wading through flooded streets in gumboots.  \n",
            "[general] Buzdar wasn’t a finger-wagging mini-Mussolini, they said; he was a man of the people.  \n",
            "[general] As time went on, however, the man of the people would toddle from one car-wreck to the next.  \n",
            "[governance] He was soon hauled up by the Supreme Court on allegations of transferring Pakpattan’s District Police Officer in the middle of the night, at the behest of a buddy called Ahsan Gujjar.  \n",
            "[governance] The inquiry report, ordered by the Supreme Court, found that the DPO’s transfer orders flowed directly from the chief minister’s office.  \n",
            "[governance] The case concluded only after the unconditional apologies of Mr Buzdar, Mr Gujjar, and the Inspector General of Police.  \n",
            "[governance] Then came the overall malaise — seven police chiefs were changed over three years, one of which prompted the resignation of Nasir Khan Durrani.  \n",
            "[governance] Mr Durrani had shepherded the PTI’s celebrated police reforms in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and was brought to Lahore for the same purpose.  \n",
            "[policy] \"\"If the experiment of unity in command could be successful in KP, then it is also possible to replicate it in Punjab,\"\" he would say some months before he passed away.  \n",
            "[governance] It didn’t happen, and the much-reviled thaana culture stayed where it was.  \n",
            "[corruption] And when the sugar scandal hit, the commission of inquiry held Mr Buzdar responsible for authorising a whopping Rs2.9 billion subsidy, which it deemed unjustified.  \n",
            "[corruption] Per the report, \"\"The Chief Minister Punjab pleaded his case that the subsidy was granted by the Cabinet and it was a collective decision. However, keeping in view the minutes of the meeting dated 06-12-2018, which the CM Punjab claims to have forgotten, clearly indicates otherwise.\"\"  \n",
            "[corruption] News reports would point to three separate summaries moved by Punjab’s finance secretary opposing the subsidy, all of which escaped the executive’s attention.  \n",
            "[corruption] Nor did the ‘honest man’ image endure — soon enough, NAB got into the picture.  \n",
            "[corruption] Cases opened up against the chief minister on a variety of allegations, from accepting graft over liquor licenses to illegal land allotments, while his principal secretary came under investigation for assets beyond means.  \n",
            "[corruption] Eventually, the consensus that Mr Buzdar was a hapless choice had settled in the province, to the extent that the Punjab government’s leading achievements — like the rollout of the Sehat card, or the fightback against the coronavirus pandemic — were attributed to provincial ministers and bureaucrats, rather than their boss.  \n",
            "[governance] In the same vein, Mr Buzdar’s actual contributions, such as reprioritising development in South Punjab, were whistled away.  \n",
            "[governance] Most important, unlike other ex-Leaguers, Mr Buzdar proved a complete loss at bridge-building.  \n",
            "[governance] It took the Chaudhrys to stitch up the PTI’s Senate seats from Punjab, and it was the Chaudhrys again whose numbers took on outsized importance in light of their doddering chief minister.  \n",
            "[governance] Today, the PTI dissidents, a forward bloc by any other name, refuse to accept anything less than his removal.  \n",
            "[general] Whatever their motives, the fact remains that the galaxy of requests to drop Mr Buzdar — whether from his own party, the bureaucracy, the establishment, the voters, or the proverbial man in the street — went unheard by the prime minister.  \n",
            "[general] In another universe, a solid ministry in the land of the five rivers would have acted as Mr Khan’s finest defence.  \n",
            "[governance] Instead, Usman Buzdar opened up another battlefront in the larger struggle over no-confidence; his appointment the single most scorned personnel choice of the PTI’s three years in power.  \n",
            "[general] Read: PML-N, Tareen group agree on CM Buzdar ouster.  \n",
            "[general] That Pakistan is only a quasi-democracy, even under democrats, is an old trope.  \n",
            "[governance] Well before Imran Khan took power, a handful of commentators had begun using the latest variant — ‘hybrid regime’ — as a buzzword that fit between democracy and dictatorship.  \n",
            "[general] This was part of a longer-running theme, made popular by Western academics.  \n",
            "[general] The country was dubbed a hybrid regime by Katherine Adeney in Democratization in 2015, by Philip Oldenburg in Commonwealth and Comparative Politics in 2017, and by that beloved mouthpiece of European billionaires everywhere, The Economist, in early 2018.  \n",
            "[general] At all such times, the PML-N’s Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi were in power (by way of context, Modi’s India, at the height of its Hindutva project, merited a ‘flawed democracy’ tag on the same index).  \n",
            "[general] The momentum picked up after Mr Khan took over, as the term ‘hybrid regime’ took on wider currency among the prime minister’s critics at home, and even among a few of his supporters.  \n",
            "[general] Yet implicit in this — locals repeating an awkward bit of Western pol sci — was that Mr Khan had somehow greater or more sophisticated support from the establishment than the civilians of old.  \n",
            "[general] This rather loopy diagnosis ran up against the past six decades of Pakistan’s history, where new-fangled civilians were supported, then tolerated, and then opposed by the establishment.  \n",
            "[general] To label the PTI government as some sort of outlier was as inaccurate as it was ahistorical.  \n",
            "[general] Smokers' Corner: Hybrid regimes and their discontents.  \n",
            "[general] The same held true even for the country’s most ‘civilian’ periods: here’s The New York Times at the dawn of the Bhutto era, on 29 December 1971: \"\"Although he played an important role in the ouster of Gen Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan from the Presidency on Dec 20, Air Marshal Rahim Khan and his colleagues chose to eschew a military coup, and the air force commander has elected to remain in the background. The former Royal Indian Air Force pilot shares military power under the Presidency of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto with Lt Gen Gul Hassan Khan, who holds the title of Acting Commander in Chief of the Army.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] Mr Bhutto ran a martial law administration which then segued into a years-long emergency, before again imposing martial law, and then ultimately being overthrown by the same generals he sent into Lahore, Karachi, and Hyderabad.  \n",
            "[general] Over a decade later, when generals Aslam Beg and Asad Durrani handed out money bags to Mian Nawaz Sharif’s IJI during the 1990 polls, it would be censured by the Supreme Court.  \n",
            "[general] Of course, the same insufferable Aslam Beg was once praised for giving democracy a chance, much like Gul Hasan and Rahim Khan.  \n",
            "[general] (The latter two were sacked soon after, while Mr Beg was denied an extension.)  \n",
            "[general] By 2017, the trend of the two now-opposition parties, the PPP and the PML-N, to cry interference when their fortunes were on the slide, and then praise the establishment’s neutrality whenever they were in the upswing, had become little more than a piece of rhetoric — the opposition would play ball with the deep state when it favoured them, and call for civilian supremacy when it didn’t.  \n",
            "[general] This was most evident with the rise, fall, and return of the PDM.  \n",
            "[general] Two years ago, this contributor wrote in these pages, \"\"The Pakistan Democratic Movement is neither democratic nor a movement. It’s an inter-elite skirmish over relevance, closure of NAB cases, and closeness to the establishment.  \n",
            "[general] For all his talk of mujhay kyun nikala, Mian sahib loved helping nikalufy prime ministers Junejo, Benazir, Benazir again, and Yusuf Raza.  \n",
            "[general] When a man does something four times, odds are he can do it a fifth.’  \n",
            "[general] That fifth try seems to have presented itself, and Mian sahib seems intent so far on going for it.  \n",
            "[general] He’s not told us yet whether he’s motivated by civilian supremacy, or by the postings of lieutenant generals.  \n",
            "[general] As for the government he seeks to remove, the PTI didn’t take too long to pick up on the same throat-clearing from the traditional parties.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"In 2013’s election, the judiciary was with [Nawaz Sharif], and so was the military,\"\" Mr Khan said a while ago.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"His problem today is that the judiciary has become neutral, and so has the military.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] As recent rallies attest, the premier’s views on neutrality have since evolved.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"Only animals are neutral,\"\" he said in Balambat.  \n",
            "[general] There’s been another sort of evolution as well, as the PTI in power steers around all of its own campaign promises relating to the shadowlands.  \n",
            "[general] Mr Khan had vowed to put a stop to missing persons, as well as ensuring the Asghar Khan case was brought to its logical end.  \n",
            "[general] Neither happened.  \n",
            "[general] He had also said that General Musharraf shouldn’t be allowed to escape trial — his condemnations of emergency rule played loud and long on the airwaves.  \n",
            "[general] Once in office, however, the PTI government’s lawyers fought tooth and nail to reverse the special court’s treason verdict.  \n",
            "[general] Regardless, the PTI’s party faithful have been quick to cite the advantages of same-page-ism as an antidote to instability — the competence of the NCOC, at the height of the pandemic, was one such example, as was the air battle of February 27, 2019, when Pakistan’s diplomatic skill melded well with its defensive readiness, downing India’s intruding warplanes, and deterring Modi.  \n",
            "[general] But as of late last October, there was a chill in the air — an impasse over the appointment of the new intelligence chief dragged on for three weeks at the Prime Minister’s Office.  \n",
            "[general] Day after day, the press would ask about the notification, and each day, Islamabad would dodge the question.  \n",
            "[governance] While the DG ISI is an appointee of the prime minister, he has at all times answered to the army chief.  \n",
            "[general] Attempts to go over and above that equation by picking their own loyalists ended in tears for both Benazir Bhutto (who chose the clueless Shamsur Rehman Kallue) and Nawaz Sharif (who chose the doomed Ziauddin Butt).  \n",
            "[general] By the time the summary was issued at last, the ‘same page’ had started tearing — though there came a series of fevered statements from Islamabad that all was well, the signs said otherwise.  \n",
            "[general] And just like that, it was open season on the centre.  \n",
            "[governance] On March 8, the opposition submitted its resolution for a vote of no-confidence against the prime minister.  \n",
            "[governance] The resolution cited spiralling inflation and mass distress among the people, besides kicking off the countdown to the actual vote in the assembly.  \n",
            "[governance] At the joint press conference later that day, Asif Ali Zardari, flanked by Shehbaz Sharif and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, told the press, \"\"We friends in the opposition all thought: it’s now or never.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] The PPP co-chair was his usual, unfazed self: \"\"We will, God willing, free Pakistan, you, and your upcoming generations, from this difficulty,\"\" he said.  \n",
            "[general] \"\"Jiye Bhutto.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] That neither gent could actually explain why ‘now’ was different from before, or why the economic crisis — as prevalent, if not worse, in 2020 and 2021 — had become unbearable, or why Notification-gate had been the sole difference in the interim, was hardly unexpected.  \n",
            "[governance] There would be a vote, and that was that.  \n",
            "[governance] To remove a prime minister via the assembly, the law of the land is clear.  \n",
            "[governance] In the first stage, a resolution seeking a vote of no-confidence is submitted under Article 95(1) of the Constitution; the opposition did just that on March 8.  \n",
            "[governance] Since the parliament isn’t in session, the opposition has also moved to summon it.  \n",
            "[governance] It’s submitted a requisition (a fancy word for an official request) under Article 54(3).  \n",
            "[governance] Once a requisition is received, the Constitution says that \"\"the Speaker shall summon the National Assembly to meet, at such time and place as he thinks fit, within fourteen days of the receipt of the requisition.\"\"  \n",
            "[governance] This means two things: that the Speaker has until March 22 to summon the assembly, and also — courtesy the word ‘shall’ — that he is bound to do so.  \n",
            "[governance] Once the assembly opens, Article 95(3) provides that the no-confidence resolution shall not be voted upon before the expiration of three days, and less than seven days.  \n",
            "[governance] We’re thus looking at a window of voting between March 25 and March 29; hence PTI leaders announcing that the vote shall be held after the party’s rally on March 27, in the two days remaining.  \n",
            "[general] Explainer: How does a no-confidence motion work?  \n",
            "[governance] For the resolution to pass, the opposition needs a simple majority of the total membership in the House — the magic number is 172.  \n",
            "[governance] If the prime minister loses the support of any two coalition partners — that is, any buddy comedy of BAP, MQM, GDA or the PML-Q — it could mean lights out for a PTI dispensation, to say nothing of a revolt from within.  \n",
            "[governance] Per the rules of procedure, the vote itself is in the open — members that want the prime minister gone will rise and file out of an entrance while their numbers are counted; those that support him are free to stay in their seats.  \n",
            "[governance] Should the treasury benches decide to turn on their prime minister, an open vote will make for a series of public betrayals.  \n",
            "[governance] If the vote fails, everyone remains where they are.  \n",
            "[governance] If the vote succeeds, the prime minister will go down with his whole cabinet.  \n",
            "[law and order] As astute legal eagle Moiz Jaferii has explained, the cabinet is an extension of the premier that picked it; it’s also why it stood automatically dissolved when Nawaz Sharif was disqualified by the Supreme Court after the Panama verdict.  \n",
            "[governance] Once the premier is voted out, the next thing the Assembly must do, \"\"to the exclusion of any other business,\"\" is elect a new prime minister.  \n",
            "[governance] Until they do so, the country will be run by the president, who will have stepped into the cabinet’s void.  \n",
            "[general] While simple enough, the ruling party’s legal brains have since misread another law, Article 63A — disqualification for defecting parliamentarians — as an escape hatch; they claim the Speaker can bar anyone from crossing the floor, and thereby kill the vote.  \n",
            "[general] This is entirely wrong — 63-A neither bars members from voting, nor disqualifies them in advance.  \n",
            "[general] It acts as punishment: a member is disqualified after voting against the party, and not before.  \n",
            "[general] To pretend otherwise would be sentencing a man for a crime he’s yet to commit.  \n",
            "[general] A holdover from Mian sahib’s 14th Amendment — one that made its way into the 18th — Article 63A is bad law; the result of a Faustian bargain between the same parties the PTI rails against.  \n",
            "[general] But its process for disqualifying defectors is long and convoluted, and winds through the House, the ECP, and the Supreme Court in appeal.  \n",
            "[general] The Speaker has no room for knocking out members in advance.  \n",
            "[general] In fact, 63A has always acted as a deterrent.  \n",
            "[general] If our lawmakers wanted, they could have just slapped a blanket ban on floor-crossing, yet they’ve allowed members to vote differently.  \n",
            "[general] Freedom of expression, perhaps, just not after expression.  \n",
            "[general] Read: No-trust move — Can the NA speaker dismiss votes of dissident lawmakers?  \n",
            "[general] As the country heads for climax, things look to get worse before they get better.  \n",
            "[general] Most distressing is the announcement of dual rallies in the capital in the last week of the month — the prime minister has called one on March 27 at D-Chowk — the very same Waterloo that hosted the 2014 dharna — after which Maulana Fazl announced a countermarch on March 25.  \n",
            "[general] Already, the Supreme Court Bar Association has taken this future collision to the apex court, praying that parliamentarians be allowed to cast their vote in the assembly.  \n",
            "[general] ‘It is evident from the political history of our country,’ reads the petition, ‘that preventing the constitutional process from taking its course has produced dire consequence for democracy and rule of law.’  \n",
            "[governance] But the onus of preserving the rule of law falls squarely on the centre.  \n",
            "[action] To announce a power show in the middle of a vote like this is to be consciously risking violence.  \n",
            "[governance] It is the prime minister’s responsibility to call off a potential disaster, and Maulana Fazl’s to follow suit with his yellow-shirts.  \n",
            "[general] Yet if words are any indicator, the premier is saying whatever he can to ramp up the temperature.  \n",
            "[general] Ever since the opposition submitted its resolution, Mr Khan has been barnstorming the country.  \n",
            "[general] While the usual stump speeches have followed, the jibes are anything but routine — Mr Khan has called Shehbaz a boot-polishing ‘showbaz’, and Mr Zardari a murderer and a thief.  \n",
            "[general] He’s told a crowd in Lower Dir that General Bajwa asked him not to call Fazlur Rehman ‘Diesel’, but that the people had chosen that name for the maulana anyway.  \n",
            "[general] Little of this is unprecedented for the prime minister.  \n",
            "[general] And whatever the opposition parties might say, little of this is unprecedented for them either.  \n",
            "[general] ZA Bhutto referred to the millions of Bengalis he betrayed to the Yahya junta as ‘sons of swine’.  \n",
            "[general] Mian sahib would call PPP leaders dog-washing puppets; his younger brother promised to drag them in the streets.  \n",
            "[general] And in this latest fistfight, the new opposition is the same as the old opposition.  \n",
            "[general] As the dissidents from PTI-Sugar somehow tumbled down the chimney of Sindh House, taking refuge, PPP leaders shrug their shoulders — MNAs are staying there for their own good.  \n",
            "[general] Besides, if Islamabad wasn’t above sending the police in after Fazl’s yellow soldiers in the Parliament Lodges, it wouldn’t be above arresting its own Trojans from Sindh House.  \n",
            "[corruption] To Mr Khan, however, Sindh House is a den of weak wills and bags of cash — this is how whole governments are stolen.  \n",
            "[general] Only, Pakistan has seen this film before.  \n",
            "[general] It was Balochistan House three decades ago, where Aslam Beg shook down Mehran Bank boss Yunus Habib for gazillions of rupees.  \n",
            "[general] Or the year before that, when it was the lovely hilltop resorts of Dilkusha and Brightland in Murree, where Mian sahib stuffed 60 MNAs before the no-confidence move against Benazir.  \n",
            "[general] (Some escaped: MNA Khurshid Cheema famously dashed to the PPP’s benches in the assembly, screaming ‘bachao, bachao,’ and swearing his life had been threatened.)  \n",
            "[general] But the past’s mistakes are also where they should stay.  \n",
            "[general] As of 2008, Pakistan has wheezed its way to the restoration of a parliamentary democracy, or at least some semblance of it.  \n",
            "[general] A civilian government is in its third consecutive iteration.  \n",
            "[general] Federalism is considered a good thing.  \n",
            "[general] The cornerstone of all three is a peaceful transition of power.  \n",
            "[governance] A vote of no-confidence may well be one such transition; it’s provided for in the law and Constitution — a five-year term is, after all, subject to the parliament’s pleasure.  \n",
            "[general] Yet it must also be said that not a single one of Pakistan’s prime ministers have served out their complete term, and the latest effort to keep that up has proven laughably hollow.  \n",
            "[general] Mr Khan’s critics point to skyrocketing prices, systematic censorship, Usman Buzdar, recklessness with religion, aggrieved foreign friends, the return of political victimisation, and an economy in hock to the IMF.  \n",
            "[general] His admirers speak of the beginnings of universal healthcare, expanding the social welfare net, a near-miraculous recovery from the pandemic, the February 27 deterrence, non-alignment abroad, refusing drone strikes at home, and going after the corrupt.  \n",
            "[general] As anyone can tell, little of the above is in play.  \n",
            "[general] If the prime minister stays, it won’t be because of the merits of his tenure, and if he goes, it won’t be because of his failings either.  \n",

            "[general] But a higher principle requires just a little bit of faith in the system.  \n",
            "[general] With a clean transition only one and a half year away, the idea that a prime minister can be voted in by the people — and then thrown out by those same people after five years — needn’t be so revolutionary.  \n",
            "[general] Then again, per another saying attributed to Mao (this one wrongly), \"\"History is a symptom of our disease.\"\"  \n",
            "[general] As thousands of partisans are ordered into the streets to square off against each other, as the gloved hand hovers near the phone, as men like the Chaudhrys get to decide governments, as the prime minister attempts to block the same parliament he was meant to lead, as the opposition continues to perpetuate its gormless children, one wonders when this great country will stop making history.\"\n",

            "[development] The university I built was affiliated with Bradford University in England because I was the Chancellor of Bradford University, so we affiliated it with that university.  \n",
            "[people] The boys who studied and girls who are studying at that university come from poor backgrounds, 75% from more to 80% of the medium schools study an English university degree.  \n",
            "[development] In the first year, their struggle used to have to teach them English to give them a foundation course; they struggled the first year, second year they sort of stabilized.  \n",
            "[development] And in Bradford University, the average first divisions about 12% to 13% maximum; in my university, the same Bradford University degrees examined by Bradford University professors, they got between 55 to 60% first origins.  \n",
            "[people] Poor background people who didn't even have strong basics because they had great motivation, they had greater hunger.  \n",
            "[general] So it's in sport I learned how to compete, and the most again the valuable lesson face the bad times.  \n",
            "[general] So I give you an example; once we got thrashed by India, we went to India to play ceilings; we got thrashed.  \n",
            "[general] So now the team is on the way back to Pakistan, and what is the discussion going on in the dressing room?  \n",
            "[general] How to get to Pakistan in the middle of the night so that there would be no one at the airport when we arrived at the airport at 4:00 a.m. in the morning?  \n",
            "[general] The custom people made us stand there for two hours, confiscated everything, and that made sure that it was light enough so that when we got out of the taxi drivers sort of give us hell.  \n",
            "[general] And yet at the same airport, I arrived seven years later having beaten India, and we never even made it to the customs; there were one hundred and fifty thousand people at the airport to receive us.  \n",
            "[general] So you just see, you see when you have these ups and downs in life, you the most valuable lesson you never lose your head when you go up and you know the dynamics of coping with the bad times.  \n",
            "[general] So the difference and my philosophy, I was nine years old when I wanted to be a Test cricketer.  \n",
            "[general] I watched my first cousin; my mother took me to this match in major; he scored a century against England, and I looked at him and I said I want to be a Test cricketer.  \n",
            "[general] And it never occurred to me that I would never become a Test cricketer; I always thought it was a matter of time.  \n",
            "[general] I never realized the struggle I had to go through.  \n",
            "[general] Similarly, when I became, when I went, my mother died of cancer, I didn't realize that there was no cancer hospital all this time.  \n",
            "[development] And then I realized that you know I could take my mother out for cancer treatment; what happened to 95% of the people in the country?  \n",
            "[development] So that's when I decided I would build a cancer hospital.  \n",
            "[general] I have to confess I was never much of a charity type of a guy; I was not into really giving people because basically the philosophy of profession sport is that there are no prizes for coming second; you do not have compassion for the losers.  \n",
            "[general] So it was actually watching that pain that I decided, watching my mother suffer, I decided I wanted to build this hospital.  \n",
            "[general] I never realized how difficult it would be; four years of running around, I wasn't getting anywhere.  \n",
            "[general] And then Mr. Razak, now this sitting here, he was on the board of governors and he knows the meeting we called 20 doctors of Lahore, top doctors, and said look how do we go about building this cancer hospital.  \n",
            "[general] And this is after four years of running around like a headless chicken, and out of 2019, said you can't build a cancer hospital in Pakistan.  \n",
            "[general] And one said that you might be able to build it; you cannot give free treatment to poor cancer patients because it's very expensive treatment.  \n",
            "[development] So my dream was to build the hospital, and so what I went through, the things I had to do was the greatest learning experience in my life.  \n",
            "[development] And eventually when we built the hospital, just to give you an idea, the hospital was built in 700 million rupees; the annual loss the hospital suffers for treating 75 percent of the cancer patients free, which was my dream.  \n",
            "[development] It wasn't just the dream of building a hospital; it was more people should get free treatment.  \n",
            "[development] The annual loss is 10 billion rupees; the hospital built for 700 million and your losses 10 million.  \n",
            "[general] So imagine, I mean had I had someone told me, but look this is what you after building it, you have to spend 10 million collecting every year.  \n",
            "[governance] And then I need that good politics; everyone laughed at me; there's no precedence of in a two-party system a third party coming through.  \n",
            "[governance] There's no precedent; look at England, look at the US; you can't break through because they ain't wrenched; they have systems a third party, an outsider.  \n",
            "[governance] So for 15 years people laughed at me; for 15 years people I was the butt of all the jokes in politics; there was me sincerely going around but we want good people to come; let's all good people get together.  \n",
            "[governance] And I didn't realize good people were the most cowardly people; they were scared of coming into politics.  \n",
            "[general] So anyway, the thing is the almighty has given all of us tremendous potential; we are his greatest creation.  \n",
            "[general] Former group guard problem as we don't know this, and we let ourselves down because that potential we only achieve that potential if we know how to struggle.  \n",
            "[general] We only achieve that potential if we have these big dreams, and whatever the human mind can picture can happen.  \n",
            "[general] This is how much potential all of our self-problem we face is that we give up all the way when the bad time comes; you know we put up our hands and say you we have a plan B.  \n",
            "[general] The human potential, if you the bigger the dream with the bigger the struggle, but you achieve it when you do not have a plan B; there is no going back; you have to burn your boats wherever you go after a big ambition; you never never never take off compromising on that dream.  \n",
            "[governance] So now I come to my dream of Pakistan; you see I believe and I always believed because I grew up in the 60s when you cannot imagine the optimism we grew up with about Pakistan.  \n",
            "[development] It was one of the fastest growing countries; a head of state, a Yukon went to the United States; the president of the US came to receive him at the airport; he had a ticker-tape reception.  \n",
            "[development] Open car people throwing, you know those when they heard it greet those people in the US; he goes to England; he is treated like royalty.  \n",
            "[development] Pakistan, there was hope; people believed the country and potential; it was the fastest growing country in the 60s in Asia; we were a model for development.  \n",
            "[development] Software you came to Pakistan, Malaysia; they looked upon us in HSN; I started with Malaysian princes or university degrees were recognized everywhere.  \n",
            "[development] So I grew up with this thing; we had this room, so we let ourselves down, and we let ourselves down because unfortunately, we could not; a democracy couldn't get grounded in Pakistan.  \n",
            "[governance] When the democracy faltered, we had the army; when the army came, they wanted their own puppets; when they so who were not leaders and cemented to this famous musical chairs.  \n",
            "[governance] But I always believed that the moment Pakistan had good governance, this country would rise.  \n",
            "[governance] And the moment Pakistan went back to its original vision, there was a recent Pakistan was made; we keep forgetting why was it made.  \n",
            "[governance] The reason given by the founding fathers in the ideological father of Pakistan, the great Iqbal, and what a great leader Jarek I dasn't, a brilliant mind, the most outstanding barrister in British India, highest-paid barrister, brilliance man of complete integrity.  \n",
            "[governance] They all, if you look at the vision of the founding fathers, they wanted Pakistan to be a humane, just society, a welfare state, and we deviated so far from the vision.  \n",
            "[governance] And nations without a vision die; why should people want to be part of a nation at this though visually?  \n",
            "[governance] So I always believed that the moment our vision, the reason why this country was made, if you could restore that vision, this country has more potential than any other country.  \n",
            "[people] The reason why this country has so much potential is because the best resource are the people; we have dynamic people.  \n",
            "[general] I mean I give you an example when I used to be playing cricket in here seven times the size of Pakistan; we thrash them squash players with the heart.  \n",
            "[people] There were more squash courts in Oxford University; Pakistan to squash their champions for Ted Ted is each hockey hardly Finals to anything.  \n",
            "[people] We had always the talent; people of Pakistan, not just habit, and we had the resources.  \n",
            "[development] I mean since I'm we didn't power what the resources the country has just out of the 14 copper and gold fields we have in record date just two of them.  \n",
            "[governance] And this and guest told with the foreign company which we are in litigation against this chairman I was speaking to them; he told me he said do you realize that these two the blocks the profit is 100 billion dollars just the profit of two blocks?  \n",
            "[development] This is just I didn't know that, and we have core reserves; we should never have a shortage of electricity; own coal reserves; we have the most for Thailand.  \n",
            "[development] What I went to China looked at the productivity of China is 3-4 times of Pakistan; oh we have six number of cow cow and buffaloes in our country.  \n",
            "[development] We are number six; average cow liter of Bell is six liters; if China is twenty-four liters quickly, Denmark is thirty liters.  \n",
            "[governance] So we have what we have done is that we will neglect research in Pakistan; we neglected the business basics, not spending money on our human resources, not spending money on education, not worrying about the education of the masses.  \n",
            "[governance] It was only for a tiny elite; which country does it that only eight hundred thousand children go to English medium schools, 3.3 million children denote the medium schools, two and half million children and be myself?  \n",
            "[governance] No one paid any attention to it, so now my vision of Pakistan, we need to return to make it into a welfare state inclusive development.  \n",
            "[development] The whole idea is now that after the 60s, the second government which is going to spend money on industrialization, we are giving incentives encouragement; we want to promote industrialization because that will create wealth.  \n",
            "[development] And from that wealth creation, we want to spend money on the bottom tier of our society.  \n",
            "[development] So we have already despite limited resources, we have the most ambitious poverty alleviation plan called issus, and we have allocated in very difficult times 190 billion rupees, the highest amount ever for a poverty alleviation.  \n",
            "[development] My belief is that if we can concentrate on the bottom section of us, the government facilitates investors, industrialists, makes it easy for them to do business.  \n",
            "[development] In our first year, we have gained 28 places in ease of doing business, improve our governance system.  \n",
            "[general] I honestly believe that we will release the potential of our people.  \n",
            "[general] We have problems; let me tell you what the challenges are.  \n",
            "[governance] But number one challenges, and by the way, I was reading a blog of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad; now remember he is probably the greatest statesman of the Muslim world.  \n",
            "[governance] His achievement in transforming Malaysia, everyone knows about it now, and 20 years he was in power.  \n",
            "[governance] And when I read his blog, he might as well have been talking about Pakistan; he said the problem they are facing is from an entrenched corrupt status quo which has been removed after 50 years one-party system.  \n",
            "[corruption] Send us we are up against a corrupt status quo which ruled Pakistan for 30 years, and they are entrenched, and they have linkages.  \n",
            "[corruption] People who benefited from a corrupt system, so our biggest challenges facing these people spreading gloom and doom every day; every day some sort of scandal comes up which is blowing up all our cash orchestrated.  \n",
            "[corruption] Basically, they do not want the government to succeed because us succeeding means not just that them out of power but they will end up in jails which some of them already are.  \n",
            "[governance] Malaysia faces exactly the same thing.  \n",
            "[governance] Secondly, we face deteriorating degenerated institutions; what corruption does is number one thing they touch.  \n",
            "[corruption] What the corrupt do is they destroy state institutions because that's the only way they can make money; if I want to make money, I have to hamstring all institutions that justice.  \n",
            "[general] So that's a big problem; you can destroy state institutions very quickly, but to restore them takes time.  \n",
            "[governance] So we are in the process; it's a slow process, but gradually we institution by institution we are restoring them.  \n",
            "[governance] The other problem we face are these huge debts accumulated by the previous couple; our first year the total amount of tax we collected, which was 4 trillion, went to debt servicing.  \n",
            "[governance] How do you how do you [ __ ] health education everything when you just are left with this small amount of tax collection?  \n",
            "[governance] This year we have to our debt servicing is 3 trillion.  \n",
            "[development] The other problem we face is the actually the biggest challenge is the energy sector; we have this huge huge circular debt in electricity.  \n",
            "[governance] And because of this, which is almost I think 1.5 trillion 1.7 trillion circular debt means every year we have this huge interest on this debt.  \n",
            "[governance] So that is a big challenge, and we have decided when we go back we will get all the stakeholders to discuss how because we cannot put more burden on the consumers of electricity because this these interests.  \n",
            "[governance] This is the other challenge that of course the problem is that you give expensive electricity to the industry, especially the small medium industry, so it reduces that competitiveness in exports.  \n",
            "[governance] So this is a big challenge; the direction we have taken is industrialization, which means wealth creation.  \n",
            "[development] Secondly, export-oriented growth.  \n",
            "[governance] So far problem have been that we which we our growth rate goes up and then we have a bit of a boom and then we go bust because we then end up with a big deficit and then we have to go to the IMF.  \n",
            "[development] This time what we are trying to do is the big difference is export-led growth, and so this change of course is quite painful because the growth rate has to come down.  \n",
            "[people] You know people are hurting in Pakistan; as I keep mentioning, I've never faced so much abuse and how much so much in the media as high as I have in the past one one and a half years being in the public eye for 40 years.  \n",
            "[general] I used to criticism because you know when you lost you you do what you were in for what you want here but this was one and a half years has been exceptional.  \n",
            "[general] I really had to develop a very thick skin; in fact, thank God mercifully, you know I know that all the dynamics of bad times.  \n",
            "[general] So the first thing you do is do not read the newspapers, and secondly, do not whatever happens do not watch the evening chat shows.  \n",
            "[general] I'm trying I try to make my team, my cabinet, I make them try and understand these mix of bad times.  \n",
            "[general] The problem is they watched the chat shows when they come; I watch them in cabinet meetings, all shell-shocked sitting there said well I don't worry well I'll get them on the same page.  \n",
            "[governance] But we have to, you know the situation with Pakistan is where you go; you have this huge interest payments on these debts.  \n",
            "[governance] Secondly, not very functional state institutions; this process if if we want to change course and improve and achieve our potential we will have to go through this difficult time.  \n",
            "[general] And interestingly, I was reading in the blog Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad saying exactly this; says be patient.  \n",
            "[general] I tell them Gibran honey; he says be patient; two years or so we will have to struggle for a while.  \n",
            "[general] But I feel as I see the potential in the country; I feel that once we stick to these reforms that will take a lot of political will and take courage to withstand all this criticism.  \n",
            "[people] The OG my only thing is I hate to see unemployment people hurting at the bottom level, and we hope now that our SAS program will kick in and we will provide safety net to the bottom tier.  \n",
            "[general] But whatever happens anyone you know when you have a sick economy you know when you when you bring in reforms and reforms is a painful process.  \n",
            "[general] I keep telling them look it's like we all want to go to Heaven's but we don't want to die or maybe it's a bad example.  \n",
            "[general] It's like you know we want to cut out the tumor but we don't want the operation or feel the pain of the operation.  \n",
            "[general] So it is going to be difficult, but I think I do feel that we have the first year has been in my opinion do have done remarkably well in the sense that our current account deficit which is the one biggest thing anyone looking into an economy of a country.  \n",
            "[general] The one thing they look upon is your current account; is it a deficit or a surplus?  \n",
            "[general] Surplus means you well, deficit means you've got problems, so we reduce it by 75 percent in the first year, which I think is a great achievement.  \n",
            "[general] And that is reflected in the rupee stabilizing; in fact, gaining a little bit; it is reflected in the stock market now which is regained all the on what it lost.  \n",
            "[development] And it's reflected in investment foreign investment in the last one year we had 200% in the foreign investment.  \n",
            "[general] So the direction is right, but I still feel that you know struggle ahead, but I'm an optimist, and I think we are on the right track, and I see good times ahead for Pakistan.  \n",
            "[general]   \n",
            "[general] Was it awesome Iran and Pakistan breakfast at Davos?  \n",
            "[general] Keter creeps a hit up karate or ham corroboree shock status that hit me module day or APNIC of to cook at the rendezvous Kiribati shocks a cigarette.  \n",
            "[general] MK he can attack a devotee Casa forum hey.  \n",
            "[general]   \n",
            "[general] The greatest resource of Pakistan are the overseas Pakistanis; some of our best minds, some of our best professions, some of the best entrepreneurs are sitting outside Pakistan.  \n",
            "[governance] And what we are trying to do is to create that environment for them to come back; if some of them are already back.  \n",
            "[governance] My finance minister was somewhere in Egypt where I don't know where you were to buy the other Reza baccarat State Bank president was in Egypt with working for MF does Tanya who was in Singapore Google.  \n",
            "[development] So we already have attracted overseas Pakistanis and we will keep creating that environment for them to come back because they are the best resource.  \n",
            "[development] And I always believed that once as we are making it easier and easier for people to do business, the cleaner governance we get our overseas Pakistanis, the highest amount of foreign investment I believe will come from overseas Pakistanis.  \n",
            "[development] Small businesses, small industries, I believe that that will be a bigger strength which will climate in the country.  \n",
            "[general] My question is first of all sir thanks a lot for presenting us.  \n",
            "[general] Oh my question is is there a plan for the government because your vision is clear; you want to make Pakistan a welfare state; you want to make it a social welfare state as well.  \n",
            "[policy] The strategies are in place; we have these programs which are placed right; what we lack is the implementation on ground; it's that the practical implementation of these policies that is something which you are lucky.  \n",
            "[governance] So is there a comprehensive plan to make it show because there's a lot of dissatisfaction amongst the masses in Pakistan as well?  \n",
            "[governance] And in those communities, I do believe that you know when you are going through a process of reforms and specifically institutional reforms, you cannot hope that one institution, the moment the government changes, it improves.  \n",
            "[governance] Especially in our case, maybe it's the first time PTI has beaten power at the federal government level, so therefore it is a slow process.  \n",
            "[governance] As I said, you can destroy an institution immediately, but to build an institution does take time, and especially when unfortunately these the government institutions were used as giving employment to people, so they're all bloated institutions.  \n",
            "[governance] I give you an example of the Health Ministry; we examine the Health Ministry and we discovered out of 370 people working in their health ministry, there are only 15 with health background; the rest all just people given employment there.  \n",
            "[governance] So it's same with BIA, same with Railways; all government corporations have been loaded with these people with no work.  \n",
            "[general] So as we all know that if for one job you have three people, no one will work, and this is what we face.  \n",
            "[governance] And then when we bring the changes in, unfortunately they go to the courts and get a stay order.  \n",
            "[governance] You know we there was a case of in one of the hospitals we discovered that in the Guardian a cardiology Institute the mortality rate was 25% out of 125 used to die.  \n",
            "[governance] So we removed the head of this department; he got a stay order; it was there for six more months.  \n",
            "[general] So it's you know there's a whole process of change takes time because we now with the new chief justice we are going to sit down and work out how to stop this nonsense where they can all go ahead whenever you try and remove someone.  \n",
            "[governance] Unless you have a process of hire and fired incentives and punishment, no institution can work.  \n",
            "[governance] So whenever you try and fire someone, they go ahead and get a stay order.  \n",
            "[general] So anyway, there's a whole process; it's a holistic change, and it will happen; it'll take time.  \n",
            "[governance] I'm my name is Isaiah namaz shortly; I'm a member of parliament from Punjab, and I am from the ruling party of PTI.  \n",
            "[general] Well if the question said I wanted to ask why is that you've mentioned Chaka Khan?  \n",
            "[general] I mean how you did great work and raised money, but one of the things that we've been seeing is that even a chocolate clan and when you were developing it, there was always a cost to doing those events and going around and raising funds.  \n",
            "[governance] When we want to represent Pakistan internationally, a crime Segel's people like a branch or three sab have stood by us and done great work.  \n",
            "[governance] But should the government not stand up now and do these things and include it in its own cost to represent itself better?  \n",
            "[governance] You see I shall I believe that we should save money from spending all these monies on these exports which are productive.  \n",
            "[governance] But a country which for the time being is trying to follow a very rigid program of austerity starting from me.  \n",
            "[general] I mean this visit is what almost ten times less than the previous prime ministers who came here.  \n",
            "[general] And the cram who came to your show and came up with the pearls of wisdom but it cost us ten times more than my visit.  \n",
            "[governance] So it's a it's an austerity program, but what we feel we should rely on we have a very nine million Pakistanis living abroad.  \n",
            "[development] And GDP of those nine million Pakistanis in my opinion is almost 50 percent of Pakistan's GDP of 200 million people.  \n",
            "[development] So we can use this resource and and bacon sponsor things.  \n",
            "[governance] So I ball for a conserve; I've stopped all my ministers from going on any junkets.  \n",
            "[governance] I don't allow them to go anywhere; they are first whatever whenever they say I've got a trip somewhere, I immediately cancel it.  \n",
            "[governance] Then they have to convince me that it is productive of Pakistan.  \n",

            "[finance] When that Pak gives money to the pleasures and then it is also famous on the difference, it has to crucify those who pay this tax, they have to give the administration torch, then that Pa dies already, they run it with taxes.  \n",

            "[finance] On the other hand, only Aman had to increase the foreign exchange reserves and that too for the benefit of entire Pakistan because as the foreign exchange reserves increase, the rupee is also getting stronger, that is, when the rupee becomes stronger, you must have seen that yesterday diesel and give the price of petrol further because our rupee has become strong.  \n",

            "[general] lindbergh I'm the president and CEO here at the u.s. Institute of Peace and I'm delighted to welcome you here today a special welcome to our esteemed guest of honor Prime Minister Imran Khan and to the delegation who has traveled far to be here with him a warm welcome to everybody who's joining us online and you can join the conversation at u.s. IP on twitter with hashtag imran khan u.s. IP and I'm delighted everyone could be here for the conversation today this is the kind of conversation that it's the hallmark of u.s. Institute of Peace which was founded 35 years ago by Congress as an independent nonpartisan national institution dedicated to reducing international violent conflict and we very strongly believe that peace is possible that peace is practical and it is absolutely essential for US and international security [policy] so we pursue our mission by linking research with policy with training and with action working on the ground with partners our Pakistan program is one of our largest here at the Institute and we've been active in the country since 2011 [cooperation] we partner with the network of civil society organizations innovators Scala C scholars and policymakers to support local programs conduct research and analysis and convene local peacebuilders [development] we've supported programs in cities and villages throughout Pakistan we focus on increasing tolerance of diversity using arts media and culture to promote dialogue and peace education [welfare] u.s. IP partners in Pakistan have reached more than 130,000 youth and has helped support their peace building activities [people] I've been fortunate to have a chance to visit and to see the extraordinary impact that these young leaders are having [action] we also work with other institutions including the police to promote police community relations and enable the police to be more effective at non-violent means of addressing conflict [law and order] we use our trusted networks in the US government and in Pakistan to facilitate 1.5 and 2.0 dialogues to offer opportunities for policy specialists and those close to decision-making on both sides to think of other solution sets and to offer innovative approaches to break through policy obstacles [policy] so we have a long history also of hosting Pakistan top political officials last year we were honored to host Pakistan's foreign minister shah mahmud Qureshi who's here with us today welcome and we're also delighted to have with us Pakistan's ambassador to the u.s. asad khan who is a good friend pleased to have you back with us today of course we are honored to have with us Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan this is his first visit to Washington since becoming Prime Minister last August [general] we have had the honor of hosting him in the past the last time you were here was in 2009 the prime minister comes to Washington at a particularly critical moment in us-pakistani relations and yesterday hope hopefully we'll hear more about it he met with President Trump for the first time to discuss cooperation between US and Pakistan [cooperation] so today we thank Prime Minister Khan for the opportunity to hear his own insights into developments in Pakistan and what we can expect from Pakistan on the international stage [development] after the Prime Minister's opening remarks I host a moderated discussion with him and then take questions from the audience we have people circulating with no cards please write down your question and pass them in to a US volunteer and we'll also be taking questions from online and with that please join me in giving a warm welcome to Prime Minister Imran Khan  [general] thank you very much Nancy the United States Institute of Peace I want to thank you for inviting me here and listening to my views about Pakistan [general] Pakistan is policy and I start with of someone like me a sportsman for 20 years international sport who ended up in politics [general] I am the first generation Pakistani my parents were born in colonial India I was the first generation who grew up in an independent Pakistan [general] we grew up with a lot of pride my parents reminded me always how awful it was to live in a colonial in a in a country where you were not you didn't have your freedom so I valued the freedom of being in an independent country [general] and we took great pride when Pakistan started growing rapidly in the 60s [development] it's not used to my voice I think it's to him in the 60s Pakistan was the fastest-growing country in the whole region [development] Pakistan was a country which gave us hope we we grew up feeling that this is a country with a destiny [general] and then things started going wrong from 70s onwards and and I was playing cricket for for two decades international sports when I finished in the early 90s and my initial thought after playing sport was to go into Social Work [welfare] I had already started building a cancer hospital my mother had died of cancer and I'd realized that there was no cancer hospital in Pakistan [welfare] so I thought I would build one specifically because poor people cannot afford cancer treatment [welfare] so I spent six seven years of my life after cricket building and then running the hospital but it was during that time I realized that this is a big country [general] Social Work was not going to change it the only way would change our country is joining politics [governance] change only comes through when you had a government and bring about a change and the reason why I joined politics was because I realized a politics was going in a direction which was a leading Pakistan to nowhere [governance] problem with most excluding countries is was exactly what was what what Pakistan was facing if you look at Africa you look at the independence movements in Africa and then the the leaders who came from the independence movement once they assumed government a similar pattern took place [governance] the moment they got power they used power for benefitting themselves [corruption] corruption was the main reason why countries could not reach their potential and Pakistan was exactly that country which in 60s while was going taking off from mid-eighties onwards it started going down because of corruption [corruption] corruption of the ruling elite [corruption] so my main when I formed my party in 1996 it was on an anti-corruption platform [corruption] and I campaigned for 15 years and the political wilderness talking about corruption and could not make people understand the relevance the relation between corruption and poverty [corruption] people could not relate the truth somehow in in Ex colonial countries people thought taking money from the government was nothing wrong with it because it was an it was not your government it was a foreign government which was ruling over you [corruption] so if you evaded taxes livers you know you were you not doing anything wrong and similarly corruption [corruption] so I formed my party as I said in 1996 for 15 years I had only a few people with me and no one thought I had a chance but then suddenly people began to understand what I was saying [general] so the party then began to take off about seven years ago and in 2013 we formed government in one of the four provinces and because of a performance in that one performance in that one province in 2018 we won the elections [governance] so what have I what has been the main challenge since we've come to power 10 months ago number one challenge was inheriting a country which was bankrupt [finance] we had the biggest current account and fiscal deficits [finance] but worse what corruption does is it it's not just a question of bankrupting a country and and money being laundered out of the country [corruption] what happens is the ruling elites they when they make money when they make money out of corruption they then have to take it out of the country because otherwise people would know ask them questions where did the money come from [corruption] so you suffer in two ways number one the money which should go to human development ends up going into people's pockets but secondly that that money leaves the country and in my opinion which I spoke to president Trump yesterday the biggest problem that the world faces is about trillion dollars leaving developing and poor countries [finance] and either book going into offshore accounts or they end up in Western countries and this is impoverishing this is causing more deaths than through terrorism than through drugs [welfare] the amount of people dying of hunger and disease lack of education not having clean drinking water is because of the ruling elites and developing world taking that money out and parking it into as I said offshore accounts or Western countries [corruption] so we've we've we faced a similar situation we had the the biggest current account deficit and fiscal deficit but the other aspect of corruption is then in order for the ruling elites to take money out they have to destroy the state institutions [corruption] because if the institutions are strong they would not be able to take the money out [governance] for instance if your anti-corruption body is strong if your justice system is as working is robust if your Taxation Department like equivalent to the Inland Revenue here or the IRS air if these institutions are strong you cannot take money out of the country [governance] but but that's the biggest damage these corrupt ruling elites do to developing world they destroy these institutions [corruption] so you know you can recover the money but what you can't do build institutions takes time [governance] so what we are the biggest challenge we have faced since we've been bar is trying to build the state institutions and you know we have we have succeeded we have turned around various institutions but it is a slow process [governance] the relationship which we had with our neighbors the other priority we have tried to instill in Pakistan amongst the people is that we must have good relationship with all our neighbors [cooperation] because Pakistan at the moment most of all needs stability we need stability for economic progress [finance] we need peace and so for peace we need her to have a good relationship with our neighbors [cooperation] so first was me trying to reach out to India [cooperation] India is a you know a country which we've had turbulent relationship with but unfortunately because of one issue of Kashmir whenever we have tried whenever relationship has got started to move in the right direction with India some incident happens and and that's all a related to Kashmir we go back to square one [cooperation] and so we I reached out to my counterpart in India the Indian Prime Minister a short end that you know we you you come one step towards us we will go two steps towards you [cooperation] because the biggest problem India and Pakistan face is poverty and the best way we can reduce poverty is if we start trading with each other [finance] the next was Afghanistan we again have had a difficult relationship with Afghanistan and so we have reached out I have invited President Ghani to Pakistan [cooperation] and you know I it's a sort of long story but we are moving towards fortunately we're all moving towards the same direction there's a convergence now in Pakistan in the u.s. that is there is no military solution in Afghanistan [army] so we are all working towards the peace process [cooperation] similarly with Iran we've had sort of a decent relationship with Iran without you know it's not really a warm relationship but a decent relationship with them [cooperation] so we reached out to all our neighbors and the next is the u.s. us is a superpower you have to have good relationship with the US whether you like it or not [cooperation] so so I was a bit worried when I was invited to meet President Trump you know I have never been in limelight public life for 40 years and so when I'm going to meet people who are famous or well-known or in power you you'd normally get advice that you know how what you should do what questions you should ask when you meet them but never in my life have I had so many suggestions when I before I was going to meet president travel inundated and I have to say that it was one of the most pleasant surprise not just for me for my delegation the wave the hospitality the way he straightforward charming where he treated us so we were all blown over we loved the meeting with the president yesterday [cooperation] but above all we we decided on how we will now have a close relationship between Pakistan and the u.s. [cooperation] how we will now ensure that there is no communication gap the the period from 2003 or for - to 2015 was the worst in the relationship with Pakistan in the u.s. [governance] Pakistanis felt that they were fighting the u.s. war it was no Pakistani was a modern 9/11 Taliban were in Afghanistan al Qaeda was an Afghanistan but Pakistan ended up involved in that war then we lost 70,000 people we lost over 100 billion dollars lost raw economy and yet there was mistrust [governance] Pakistan felt it was doing its best it it could have stayed out of the war and yet Pakistan participated in the war and Pakistan took a battering there was a point when people like us thought are we going to survive because there were suicide bombs going on every day there there were no sports team used to visit Pakistan forget about Investors and so we passed through a terrible period [general] but at the same time the u.s. thought we weren't doing enough we're playing a double game so that was in my opinion the worst it was the worst a phase between the you relationship of between US and Pakistan [general] I was one of those and I came here I think in 2009 and I tried to explain to people here that there was no military solution enough [army] I met then Democrats hadn't come into power the elections hadn't happened just before President Obama won the elections [general] I tried to explain - I had a meeting organized his daughter Akram here he organized a meeting with Joe Biden John Kerry Harry Reid towering figures of the Democratic Party and I start there and try to explain to them the history of Afghanistan of Pakistan's tribal area and tried to explain to them that this that there will be no military solution [army] but I realized they had no idea people in the US had no idea about about the history of Afghanistan and the sort of conflict they had got involved in [general] and fortunately this time everyone knows people understand so why do I think that we will now have the very best of relationship of the u.s. [cooperation] because we are all on the same page previous previously Pakistan Army was was was supposedly fighting for the u.s. this this war on terror but the u.s. did did not think we were doing enough and and in Pakistan we thought we had gone out of her way [governance] this time the Pakistan State our security forces the United States all of us on the same page that that peace in Afghanistan will now can only take place through a political settlement through dialogue [cooperation] so we are all now working on on getting the Taliban to talk to the upon government they've already they're already talking to the US and we hope that this will eventually lead to a settlement not easy it's not going to be easy because there's no centralized Taliban command it's a devolved movement but we feel that if we all work together we feel this is the best chance of there to be peace in Afghanistan [cooperation] apart from that domestically just one final word before I take your questions [general] I have I've struggled these 23 years due to to get into power most of these as I said in wilderness political wilderness [general] I was not fighting political parties I felt I was fighting a mafia and the Supreme Court of Pakistan actually when there was this famous court case where the Prime Minister was dismissed actually called the ruling party a Sicilian Mafia [corruption] and I say a mafia because this is not normal politics because they the the two ruling families had been in power or on for 30 years [governance] and when you end power for 30 years they the penetration was right down in the bureaucracy in the judiciary in the Election Commission they had enormous amounts of money [corruption] and so we won because we mobilized the people [people] we mobilized the youth of Pakistan we were very fortunate that Pakistan has a 60% of Pakistanis are below the age of 30 they became a big support the young people rallied around us and we did it was a the biggest public movement in Pakistan in the last 50 years [people] and and so we won despite having coming up against big money despite the penetration in media what the the most vilification campaign personal attacks and despite that we want because of social media this is the new it had there been no social media probably we would not have been able to beat the established parties [cooperation] and since we have been in power we are still up against the mafia [corruption] we have been the problem has been to fix the economy but at the same time we have had the entire opposition trying to destabilize the country [governance] so the twice they have tried to create this uncertainty that there's been a run on the rupee we almost had a run on the rupee because of them predicting that the all fake news that IMF had told us that the rupee would go to a certain number all wrong but putting pressure on the economy all the time [finance] finally I can say right now after 10 months we have finally stabilized the economy [finance] and we feel now that we are now after stabilizing the economy we feel that we can now move ahead and start our reforms [action] our reforms are very straightforward we believe that real development is human development so we are going to all our money all the each we've decided that all the money which we retrieved from the the criminal mafia we've started a massive accountability campaign [corruption] we will then direct it towards human development [welfare] we've started one of the biggest poverty alleviation program in Pakistan's history despite having financial constraints [welfare] but we believe that a country cannot rise if there's a small lot of rich people and a mass of poor ones [finance] this what's happened in Pakistan the gap between the rich and the poor has gone has grown with each year and the whole system is just caters for a tiny elite [corruption] the education system caters for just a tiny elite to give you an example we have we have a total of students coming from what are the elite schools english-medium schools are eight hundred thousand [education] the the children who go to government schools they are about 33 million [education] and then children to go to Theni Madras ours is 2.5 million so we have three-tiered system [education] so the first thing our government is trying to do is to synthesize the syllabus bring in science subjects other subjects into the knee mattresses which are the religious schools [education] so bring them into the mainstream similarly in the earth obedience schools teach them English so that we for higher education [education] so we're trying to bring the education system which is the biggest problem of country faces and the most difficult problem [education] so that's number one secondly is is the the Pakistan taxation system [finance] we have the lowest tax GDP ratio in the world we have out of a population of two hundred and ten million people we have only tax payer barely people 1.5 million people pay taxes [finance] so there's no way you can sustain a country if you do not accept expand the tax base [finance] so we now are in the process very difficult process convincing everyone to come into the text net there are lot of strikes going on right now but we feel that we will be able to overcome them because it's imperative now that Pakistan the Pakistani people pay taxes [finance] the the challenge of course has been that the this mafia I call this mafia in ten years just so that you understand what they have done to our country because later all people you might ask me why is this political victimization what I call accountability people would say political victimization but I just tell you what they done to our country in ten years the total debt of Pakistan in 2008 before these two parties came in but General Musharraf left the total debt of Pakistan in sixty years was six trillion rupees in the last ten years they have taken it to from six trillion to 30 trillion rupees [finance] so where has this money gone I've set up a commission a debt Commission which is now going to find out where this money disappeared [corruption] so which is why we are going to we we are going through this problem of finding out what happened to our country how come we got so indebted [finance] so the the problem with having such a huge debt is that in the last year the total tax revenue which we collected half of it to servicing debts so you can't have 210 million people just surviving on this already a very low tax base and then half of it going to debt servicing [finance] so for that we are expanding our tax base [finance] but what we are doing now in Pakistan it's the first time in 1960s any government is going to take the step we are now moving towards encouraging industrialization in 1960s Pakistan Pakistan's industry production was equal to four Asian Tigers industrial production Indonesia Malaysia Philippines Thailand the combined industrial production was equal to Pakistan's in 1960s [finance] after that unfortunately we Dina sliced our exports actually went down because of policies just did not encourage industrialization [finance] so we now have embarked on a program program of interest in dust realizing a country we are giving incentives to industry so we have the main programs in Pakistan are number one poverty alleviation we have allocated the biggest amount to alleviate poverty any money retrieved from these big crooks will go straight into the poverty alleviation program [welfare] secondly industrialization we are now encouraging our industry specifically export industry we have the trade agreements one with China where where we hope that we will be able to a free trade agreement with a preferential trade agreement with China where we hope to export our stuff to China [finance] China has imports of 2 trillion dollars so industrialization and third is agriculture Pakistan is basically an agricultural country and we are hoping to get technology transfer from Europe from China hopefully a brief spoke to companies in the United States so that we can improve our yields [development] Pakistan has the lowest yield one of the one of the most productive lands but the lowest yield so what we hope is that this three-pronged attack we will be able to raise Pakistan's economy provide employment to our people improve productivity so this is basically where we're headed [development] thank you  [general]\"\n",

            "[policy] Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday strongly emphasised that Pakistan could be \"\"partners with the United States in peace but never in conflict\"\" and criticised past policies that had led to Pakistan joining the US war on terror in Afghanistan. [policy] He made the comments during a wide-ranging speech in the National Assembly, a day after the budget for the new fiscal year was approved with a majority vote. [corruption] \"\"When we gave so many services, did they (US) praise us or acknowledge our sacrifices? Instead, they called us a hypocrite and blamed us. Instead of appreciating us, Pakistan was bad-mouthed.\"\" [general] Read:'US couldn’t win the war from inside Afghanistan after 20 years — how would it do it from bases in Pakistan?'

[policy] \"\"We decided to become a front line state for the American war on terror. [action] I questioned repeatedly, what did we have to do with the war?\"\" [governance] He said he wanted the nation to remember that period forever and the \"\"idiocy\"\" of the policies at the time.

Will they give us permission to attack him?\"\" he questioned in an apparent reference to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain. [governance] \"\"If they will not give permission then why did we? Are we subhuman or half human or do our lives not have enough value?\"\" he thundered.

[governance] \"\"We disrespected ourselves, the world did not disrespect us.\"\" [welfare] He said that overseas Pakistanis hid their faces after the raid by US Navy Seals in Abbottabad in which Osama Bin Laden was killed because \"\"our ally did not trust us enough to carry out the attack.\"\" [general] Read:10 years after his death, Bin Laden's memory lives on in Abbottabad [welfare] The events of those days dented the nation's self-esteem and Pakistanis became \"\"ashamed of themselves\"\", he said.

[policy] \"\"Afghanistan has never accepted interference from outside.

[policy] He said that the PTI government had been trying to bring election reforms for the last two years so parties would accept the results of the election even if they lost. [cooperation] However, the opposition had been refusing to discuss the proposed reforms with the government for over a year, he pointed out.

[policy] \"\"The time has come that [when] we contest elections, no one worries about being defeated through rigging,\"\" he added. [governance] He recalled that when he wanted to give a speech in parliament after being elected prime minister, the opposition refused to allow him to speak claiming that the election had been rigged. [governance] \"\"When [former US president Donald] Trump claimed the same, the media asked him to give proof.\"\" [action] He said the PTI had made efforts to stop rigging after the 2013 general elections and as a result of its efforts, a judicial commission was formed in 2015 which stated that \"\"irregularities happened when the polling ended\"\".

[finance] Moving on to the budget for FY22, the premier said he first wanted to talk about his vision. [policy] \"\"The budget should reflect a country's vision,\"\" he said and paid tribute to Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin and his team who he said had \"\"made the budget according to my vision for Pakistan\"\". [policy] Prime Minister Imran said the budget should reflect three principles: justice, humanity and self-independence. [finance] He said that when the PTI government came to power, the country's biggest problem was the current account deficit. [finance] \"\"[Pakistan] had the biggest deficit in history which means our currency was in danger. [finance] Our team was new and we had no experience ... We took many difficult steps to stabilise our economy which were painful.\"\" [finance] The premier thanked countries like UAE, Saudia Arabia and China for \"\"protecting us from defaulting\"\". [finance] He shared that his government had avoided going to the IMF initially because of its \"\"strict conditions\"\" but it was forced to do so because of the tough economic situation of the country. [finance] \"\"Then Covid came. An economy which was already in pain, it got Covid,\"\" he said, adding that Pakistan was a \"\"fortunate nation\"\" because God had \"\"specially protected us\"\" as compared to some other countries. [policy] Prime Minister Imran cited the government's decision of \"\"quickly deciding not to impose a complete lockdown\"\" as the reason that Pakistan remained protected from the worst effects of the pandemic. [governance] \"\"The opposition attacked us, we were criticised for two months for no lockdowns,\"\" he recalled. [action] After the coronavirus situation improved, the government \"\"quickly decided to open construction,\"\" he said, adding that it also tried to reopen agriculture and export sectors as well. [action] \"\"The State Bank of Pakistan incentivised and helped industry. [welfare] We helped small and medium industries; 20.5 million households were given money through our Ehsaas programme. [general] So, thank God we got out in a splendid way. [finance] We saved the economy and because we imposed smart lockdowns in a focused way, we saved people.\"\" [development] He cited the government's \"\"protection\"\" of agriculture as well as record crop production for the 3.9 percent economic growth rate in FY21. [development] A big reason for the record crop production was the government's decision to make sure that farmers were paid the full support price on time, he added. [action] Talking about further measures his government had taken, he said: \"\"We incentivised export industry and it grew 17pc in one year. [finance] Our exports in June were $2.7 billion which is an all-time record for the month in Pakistan. [action] \"\"We held negotiations with the construction industry and tried to give them incentives because when [that industry] starts running, 30 related industries also start.\"\" [policy] The government was \"\"very clear about Pakistan's direction in the future\"\", the premier emphasised, saying the country's economic growth would be led by exports. [finance] \"\"One reason for an increase in imports is import of machinery. [development] With time, we will reach record exports. [finance] We are also giving attention to small and medium industries (SMEs). [policy] The finance minister is looking at ways and devising a policy to give them loans and ease regulations. [development] \"\"In agriculture, we are doing many things. [welfare] Punjab is introducing the Kisan Card which will have a database of farmers, and small farmers will [receive direct] subsidies on fertilisers and pesticides.\"\" [welfare] The premier said he was happy because the budget for FY22 allocated the \"\"highest amount for social protection in Pakistan's history\"\". [welfare] Pakistan was moving towards becoming an Islamic welfare state for the first time, he said. [welfare] \"\"By next month, we will have data on all income levels of families and according to that, the [poorest] 40-50pc families will be brought into the [government's social welfare] programme. [welfare] We have dedicated Rs500bn for them,\"\" he said, disclosing that it would include interest-free loans, health cards, technical education, low-cost housing and scholarships. [general] Reacting to the prime minister's speech, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said the premier had spoken about an \"\"alternate reality, alternate country and alternate economy\"\". [governance] He said that Pakistanis did not want to listen to history or Islamic lessons or what was happening in Scandinavia. [general] Instead, they wanted to listen to the prime minister talk about what was happening in Pakistani cities and what solutions he had to the nation's problems, the PPP chairperson added. [governance] Bilawal questioned whether the performance of the government's economic team was worthy of congratulations when the prime minister had \"\"fired [finance ministers] three times\"\". [governance] A day earlier, the National Assembly had passed the budget for the new fiscal year with majority vote amid a dismal showing by the opposition. [general] A confident-looking Prime Minister Imran had attended the proceedings for only 50 minutes and left the assembly hall even before final vote on the budget after realising that his presence was no more required in the house to ensure the presence of the treasury members who had clearly outnumbered the opposition. [governance] The prime minister had entered the assembly hall at a time when the chair had already ordered a headcount on the demand of the opposition on the motion moved by the finance minister to take up the finance bill for consideration and final vote. [policy] The motion was approved with 172-138 votes. [governance] When the budget was put for approval through a voice vote, almost all the PML-N members had left the house leaving behind the PPP and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam members.\"\n",

            "[general]  in New York morning bouncing on cotton relate well Campu the video on foreign relations and we are honored and thrilled to begin it with Prime Minister Imran Khan the Prime Minister of Pakistan he has been Prime Minister for just over a year prior to that he was a member of the National Assembly before politics he served as UNICEF Special Representative for sports had a small career in the world of sports where he is widely recognized as one of the great cricket players in history and led Pakistan's national team to victory at the World Cup a lot of other things he was at Oxford in the early in mid-1970s among with others Tony Blair benazir bhutto and quite a few other distinguished people who went on to have extraordinary careers where we're going to do it is the Prime Minister and I will have a conversation for a few minutes bless you somebody and then we will open it up to you to the members for our questions Prime Minister also I should say has a packed schedule so we are going to try to end this so he can brave the traffic by just under an hour from now ask you to remain seated when he goes I can't reserve so one question people again thank you and welcome sir one question about your previous life is there anything that you took from your previous life of cricket that has served you well in the world of politics that you now find yourself well we should thank you very much for inviting me here giving me an opportunity to talk about my country click it like any sport I think it teaches you the most invaluable lesson of life and basically battles that whenever you are aiming at some goal in life it teaches you how to struggle the ability to take the bad times the setbacks so the quality of success is not how you handle the good times but how you handle the bad times and how you cope with them how you learn from the setbacks what get demoralized so that's the only way I could struggle for 22 years before I got into this position let's talk about your economy from them if we are if we made over the years I believe Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund have reached more than a dozen agreements you just for each one rather recently on the scale of six billion dollars you yourself and you ran for this job you are critical of it that you've now entered into it where is Pakistan having such difficulty economically that it has to repeatedly turn to the IMF [finance][policy] the moment you have a deficit related to spread out the count or fiscal deficit means you're not managing their economy properly and it's just like the household if the house is going into a deficit you you know you have to raise your income cut your expenditure so this inability of successful government to manage the economy is why we keep lining up with the IMF [finance][governance] we unfortunately the biggest current account deficit and Pakistan history and so the first year has been a real struggle to basically fix this deficit and I'm very proud to say that we have really come down this deficit almost by 70 percent [finance][development] we now have an economy that is heading in the right direction simple reason was that previously we had a 5% growth rate the battle's based on imports this time what we're doing is restructure the economy so that it's an export-based growth reproduce you know really how an economy goes up so that has been the main reason why you know we had to go to the IMF because we had this huge current account deficit also when we talk about our relationship with China Pakistan is on the short list of the countries that received the most Walton Road investment from China so this was a two questions flow from it focus dramatically exacerbate with that challenge given the nature of Chinese support and how does Pakistan make the claim that it's going to retain its full sovereignty given that it's allowing or inviting China introduced progress on such as well let me just say that the situation which we follow that has been when 13 months ago we came into power was probably the worst economic situation and so China really helped us but we were right at the rock bottom they hurt us supported our by giving a spoonful of foreign exchange reserves very important at that time in fact we were staring at it default so China has taught along with Saudi Arabia UAE to beef up our results and what China is our ask right now is an opportunity they have a two trillion dollar import market and so China has given us a prevention a preferential trade agreement where we can export to China at the same terms as the ASEAN countries so this is a great opportunity apart from that we have this opportunity now to get Chinese industry to relocate in Pakistan bring in technology so China has given us a great opportunity to lift ourselves up from where we are right now many talks are not kind of have a lot of difference addressed before we turn to the members here they ask the tough questions by the way I'm just here I'm gonna roll you into a sense of complacency let's have a us-pakistani relations until disclosure I've been involved with them many times in the US government and each side has something of a narrative of frustration you've been giving us with the other radical sentence the truth from the memoir about two matters place until recently with the US Secretary of Defense and I'm quoting here although the countries I've dealt with are considered Pakistan to be the most dangerous because of the radicalization of its society and the variability nuclear weapons these matters is a respected temperate man so when you hear someone like that writing writing those words well what is what is your reaction just that I do not just fully understands why Pakistan that they radicalized you know there's just a short history which everyone may or may not know in 1980s when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan Pakistan along with the United States helped by the United States we organize the resistance to the Soviets and the resistance was organized by a defining isi training these militants we were invited from all over the Muslim world to to do jihad against the Soviet Union and so we created these militant groups to fight the Soviets then of course fighting the Soviets jihad was glorified and I never forget when Ronald Reagan invited the Mujahideen leaders to Washington and he said they reminded him and I quote the moral equivalence of the founding fathers of United States so jihad was you know jihad is my husband Tom in 1989 Soviets in Afghanistan the United States packs up and leaves Pakistan with a lot of those who would have provided Ronald Reagan of the immoral covenants of all the problems that we were left with these groups and then kind of 9/11 and Pakistan again join the u.s. in the war on terror and now we are required to go after these groups as terrorists Google now now they were indoctrinated that fighting foreign occupation is job but now in the u.s. is a ballast and is this supposed to be terrorism so Pakistan took a real battering illness I have to serve it that I oppose but from day one I said we had frustrated these guys to fight jihad and it was a great idea and now we are telling the same boots it's terrorism so we should at least restate Newton Pakistan by joining the US after 9/11 submitted one of the biggest blunders 17,000 Pakistanis died in this we had something over 150 billion tons of 200 billion some economist Pakistan is 200 billion loss to the economy and topics which we would blame for the u.s. operating in Afghanistan I thought it was the worst there's the Pakistan the lessons learnt now I think the Pakistan government should not have pledged what they could not deliver how could they deliver do it where they were in they were insider attached in the Pakistan Army the groups that were close to the Pakistan Army the army was now trying to kill them so in a nutshell the matter says what is wrong with the both radicalized it this is why we were but as we create this job you know that we try and kill them would then try to date the state and that's why we suffer isn't that the criticism fair that you are partially responsible for difficulties in Afghanistan because Pakistan continues to Accord sanctuary provide sanctuary to the Taliban and even if you can't always succeed against radicals who are on your territory it seems to me that's totally legitimate for the United States to expect 100% effort and at times we would have argued would argue that the effort is anything but 100% you know the hair was someone who kept saying that there's never going to be a military solution in Afghanistan I kept telling Pakistan government whenever I had a chance I came here in 2008 President Obama had not taken office I spoke to see the Democrats I told them that there will never be a military solution on the palace but simply because I have read the history of Afghanistan you just have to read the history they fight each other the moment of foreign foreigner comes through they all get together and religious restarts started with the British hero three times the British tried we saw this 1 million accounts they were still the resistance was stronger after millions had been killed so I kept trying to tell this I try to explain to I remember meeting Joe Biden John Kerry having read I you know try to explain and I realize they hadn't a clue what understood honest on the politicians didn't understand what was going on and this kept going on and on and Pakistan Pakistan had two right now but it had even know we have 2.7 million refugees in Pakistan there are terms of five hundred thousand refugees living there how do we do this was from Pakistan the idea that Debbie's insurgent groups from Pakistan how we first of all the tribal area bordering Afghanistan there is group border there the dural line is a line led by the with which there is no bother there now we are sensing the border because of the allegations with title against and partner friends in the border we've also time and time said but look if you want if you want Pakistan to completely stop anyone going across then you don't take the refugees back 2.7 billion people but it's not possible but you know that at least point seven billion refugees there and expect Pakistan to completely shut the border having said that I do not think that it's because of Pakistan the US has not been able to succeed in Afghanistan simply because there is a history behind it it was never going to happen and what should be fortunately President Trump has done you know by him for there to be a dialogue and then this peaceful which was just about to be signed this is painful for us the peace deal was about to be signed and you know it's it's but when Trump has to be read it in the papers other visual batteries being discussed with us but now I'm meeting President Trump later on and I will not try and tell him but look there is there's not going to be military solution for 19 years if you have not been able to succeed you will be able to succeed another 19 years I actually agree with you that there can see a military situation that I doubt is that that could be a pitch the other holds so even if there were an agreement with the Taliban what is there about the DNA of the Taliban that leads you to believe that any peaceful Chan would be anything more than tactical I feel that this is not the Taliban which was there when in 2001 who was displaced by the u.s. things have changed you know they say that you only cross the river once this is the you know realities have changed they have learnt this was Taliban realize that they cannot control all of Afghanistan the Afghan government knows that they cannot you know there needs to be some sort of a peace deal there has to be a political settlement let's face it you only have two choices whether you fight or you have some sort of a political settlement there is no point in fighting anymore I wish that this d-lab inside that would have been ceasefire and then we would have proceeded towards the only way there's going to be the u.s. wiggle we take the troops out and they'll be peace there so I agree with you Richard it's going to be tough I never for one minute assume that this is going to be easy but it is the only way actually just actually keep the necessarily the from AR which is one ideas we would fight for military victory I agree with you that's not within reach I am profoundly skeptical of the peace agreement the third approach for as long as it takes is to support the government and basically preserve that you can in Afghanistan so we can't again become a basis for terrorist attacks it's not a solution but the United States has kept forces in other countries for more than half a century we we have supported governments it's not a solution but it might be preferable to a situation of Taliban control over the country yeah I don't think I'll ever be able to control the whole country I think there will be there will be a settlement look at people people are honest and have suffered for 40 years I mean it is inhuman what they're going through anyone with any humane feelings would want there to be peace fair every day they had one glass going and people dying so anything to actually stop this I you know I again Richard I agree with you that after the 17 years of bloodshed and the way things have gone I agree that it's not going to be easy I also don't think that if we go the other way you know it'll be just one of the same you know if Taliban today are stronger than they were for you know they being on a 2010 when lost under Wisconsin for peace talks when all book was there they're much stronger than that now and when they see that the US was about to leave you know their morale is up exactly which is why some of us are skeptical but also what I mean military is feeling stronger than before they're not going to give up if you think it's an important exchange oh yeah Osama bin Laden when he was found and killed by American troops he was just outside of your capital has really been a Pakistani investigation as a government investigation as to how that to a department but he could have been living there for so long there has been investigation but I do I don't know whether the as far as I know the apt about commercial sat down and I don't know about the conclusion was but I can tell you one thing you see I again go back the Pakistani army is I trained al Qaeda and all these groups fight and Afghanistan there always looks good but they had to be links because they trained that now as I said after 9/11 when we did a 180 degree turn and went after those groups you know not everyone agreed with us but in beyond people didn't agree with us and so as I said there were more insider attacks in Pakistan General Musharraf there were 2 attacks or in suicide attacks on it which were inspired from within the army so people you know so as far as I know and and I think there was a statement by President Obama that Pakistan military the army chief the IHI chief had no idea about this because I know because I think they were listening you know to the conversation the night the raid took place and they said so so if the walls it was probably at lower levels who already had contacts sure if I open something and I don't mean to be disrespectful but in the history the modern history of Pakistan I would say most Outsiders when they look at the prime minister as a position and they look at the strength of the opportunity staff of the army and the head of the ISI or the intelligence Directorate they would say the preponderance of power is in the hands of the other two individuals the head of the army and the head of intelligence is that a fair characterization that you really feel limited in what you can do as Prime Minister look in any democracy or any form of government democracy's function because of moral authority if the vortices lose the moral authority then the physical strength and authority lies with the army in our country because space was given due to a lack of moral authority because of corrupt governments the army you know naturally there's no vacuum so it moved in I can tell you that since I have been 13 months in power every policy of my eleven worked in our manifesto we wanted peace with all our neighbors we reopen the third powerful corridor you know opening up normally this would have had security implications our security process would have resisted our policy with Afghanistan which we reached altimeters you don't understand to president Ghani I have invited him to Pakistan we speak regularly per generation every policy of my government which was peace with our neighbors has been backed by the Pakistan Army I'll even go further the only time the Pakistan Army has got its military budget is when we my government started an austerity campaign and they followed and they actually took on charge in the military spending it's never happened before I can tell you that all policies of my government had been completely backed by the army when I spoke to mr. Prime Minister Narendra Modi I told them I said look every my country stands with me because we want peace we have decided we have a new policy but the brannis time but with India we want a new beginning you take one step towards us we come to towards you and and he sort of said are you sure you know meaning that is the army behind the army completely stands with us with our policies so in past if they beat rule I repeat it's because governments lose when democratic governments do that militant ways they have only moral authority and that's much more powerful than physical authority just two more questions for me since you raised India I wanted to get to it it may have been your hope to have improved relations with India needless to say it hasn't worked out that way so and along the way you said some pretty brutal things about Prime Minister Modi and about the philosophy of all the BJP and so forth so what is what what is it realistic path because one analogy I often draw is at the height of the Cold War the US Soviet relationship had far more dimensions to at for more substance to it then the india-pakistan relationship has now in terms of diplomatic contacts economic contacts and the rest so how do we take this relationship between two nuclear-armed rivals that have a history of conflict how do we make sure we don't the future doesn't resemble the past what is it let me say one thing this is a this base side where we stand today from day one I have written letters I've spoken to Prime Minister Modi about we have common issues we have poverty poverty is a big in the subcontinent any government that should come number one priority should be to deal with poverty climate change we spend the sub-continent I mean we are our glaciers are melting at a rapid rate we need to combine together because there are hundreds and millions of people that are going to be affected so I call them up look let's just have a new chapter let's reset our relationship and he talked about terrorism and I said look I give you an ecology it's not because of pressure from India or anyone it's a policy that we will not allow any political groups in Pakistan we were dismantling from day one and again I talked about the army the army had the other god help us we would not be able to dismantle these were militant organizations and legacy of the 80s and by helping us I told them as a net-net based a relationship and mutual trust because you know problem we have is we you know put two countries in trust each other but there are foreign minister was supposed to beat last year in this USGA and said India cancelled and then we thought maybe you know they don't want to get lost because of the Indian elections because it's an asked us BJP the Nationals party one of the agenda of course is you know they're hard on Pakistan so we stayed back then of course Obama happened where this which really brought doing stuff on an Indian convoy immediately we were blamed I I went on air I said look you give us any indication that a Pakistan over the world will take action to bombed us the Jets came is the bomb does and so we retaliated no loss of life but all the way what to of the Jets went down one in Pakistan the pilots we captured we immediately given back so you didn't go to the escalation though what did in the election campaign it was all about how Pakistan was petrified and that's why they quickly returned they tell the pilot and how Pakistan will be taught a lesson the whole election can be you just have to read it was all about anything Pakistan and and be taught a lesson we still thought okay let the elections be over will again resume elections go over and we again resumed the nothing and then we find in the a specialist in the blacklist of hackers to bankrupt us that's when we started things this is something this answer that I did that going on and then of course which we took place on August unilaterally they cast aside the UN Security Council resolution the soon law court which was bilateral between us their own constitution article 370 and that's when you said you know I said all those  things that's why I said this is an RSS agenda which they are following and I'm afraid I worried now where we are the two countries are that's why before that I asked President Trump to intervene and play a role in this because whenever we asked for other countries United Nations to help India so this is a bilateral issue when you try to talk to them this is nothing you talk about so it's very important it's two nuclear-armed countries facing each other like such as have been happen in February I asked the prime minister of a country and saying but anything can happen in such situations you don't know what what can happen we should never be in this situation and that's why I will be speaking with you and I have a board the United Nations to play a role this is why the United Nations came up to being this would have this could have effects will be of the subcontinent this is India's tradition that is this government but other governments has been not to accept third party mediation it seems to me it's the holding on India and Pakistan to essentially break this dynamic which has obviously gotten worse after all what's happened in Kashmir might not make sense for Pakistan and given where we began our conversation you've got economic priorities and the rest the last thing you need is a worsening strategic situation and in South Asia is mine that might not make sense for Pakistan to think of where I beliefs reestablishing some sort of an opening for diplomacy I said look at the situation right now there 8 million queries for 50 days had been shot inside 50 days 900,000 Indian troops have shattered in their wings 8 billion crostinis how am I going to talk about what and unilaterally they have they had reneged on international laws this was a disputed territory between party Palomita the United Nations the Security Council had given the people of Kashmir the right of self-determination which was never given to them now how do we stop to anyone how can you speak to that at least and at least what I expect the international community to do is to ask them to lift the curfew it's inhuman it's violation of every humanitarian right of the people of Kashmir I should just tell the members here before I try the questions is that the Indian Foreign Minister will be here later this week so I expect we will return to some of these are I hope you'll our proper question magic so we will have the best of the Foreign Minister Dr Shankar here sir it's now the appointed hour remember this is on the record and these are the short of the questions are the more succinct than there we can we can get in this way for microphone let us know who you are and your organizational affiliation hi good morning I'm linking worden from Human Rights Watch our discussion today has proceeded without any mention of rights for 150 million women and girls in Pakistan as Human Rights Watch is documented there are serious problems with access to education forced marriage child marriage and honor killings what are your plans to deliver justice and accountability for linen girls [welfare][people] Thanks blank of manifestos rule of law all the things you're saying is because we have weak enforcement of law we have laws protecting women we have laws protecting the weak of minorities and at times when these violations take place it's because our enforcement I implementation as weak but I can tell you right now thirteen months we have taken steps to protect our minorities we have taken steps to protect the worship places of the minorities the initiative which we have taken with the Sikh community is opening at the Qatar per corridor an unprecedented we are we are now in the process of restoring places of worship because Pakistan is also the center of Buddhist civilization and also the into so my concept of Pakistan is where all minorities are equal citizens they have all their rights are protected all the women the weaker sections were the poor people in our countries we have come up with the biggest ever poverty alleviation program despite of fiscal constraints it is one of the in our history is the biggest poverty alleviation campaign which we've started so to sum it up my idea of Pakistan is basically rule of law and not just protecting the weaker sections of the society but also helping those areas of Pakistan had better have stayed back like pata pata has merged with with Pakistan for the first time but with KP and it we have spent funds to do rehabilitate the people of water because of for the war on terror just in Caesarea understand in the World Economic Forum a clear Pakistan comes in whether they second to last in terms of the gender gap so this is it is what you're saying that the challenge is to enforce existing laws but they're actually do you really need new guys and new programs just to have girls and women have opportunity you don't need new laws but you need special packages for those sections of the society which have been left behind which includes we have this program we have is one of the biggest the most comprehensive program women in rural areas to lift them out of poverty different Jeff Laurenti mr. Prime Minister following up on your answer just now which broadened the aperture from women to minorities in Pakistan and Richards earlier question by radicalization there you have seen bombings of Shiite mosques in Qatar and elsewhere the assassination of Governor Salman Taseer by Islamic extremists the capital penalty capital death penalty case of us here Bibi who was finally allowed out of Pakistan for being a Christian who didn't entirely reverence the Prophet Mohammed and you have publishers who are fearful of Islamist attacks and such - is there any progress to be made on reforming those blasphemy laws and how pervasive is the sense of of the tiny minority fundamentalist being able to employ violence in order to enforce religious conformity and you get help from it elsewhere in the Muslim world like Saudi Arabia at being able to progress toward a more moderate Islam [corruption][governance] okay firstly be a clear one thing there is only one Islam the stickers moderate Islam with radical Islam I even heard yesterday but there was this radical Islam there is really one Islam and Islam like all human capacities has its radical majority moderates and then of course some rude attacks through every every human society has but there you might at your reference when I first went well when there were these cannas you would be beat up people because of the color of the skin so there is only one Islam and Islam we follow is the flaw islam of prophet mohammed salah arabic allah and that islam according to the prophet all of us are children of adam so we are all equal regardless of what color of our skin that Islam gave complete rights to minorities then in the state of Nevada had created a Jewish citizen when the case against the Holly for the head of state you mean he loses the cases against a Jewish citizen which means that they equal citizen district with their stand and when against the head of state that is long before in my vision of Islam all human beings regardless of the religion are equal now if we have not been able to enforce our laws it's because unfortunately unfortunately we have ruling elites that have kept themselves above law so when that happens this is the Pakistan is Ruth do you leave the country like this this countries which where you have sections of populations that elite above the law and when that happens there is no rule of law when light is right so my party is called very can stop movement for justice and justice bill justice for all human beings in fact when we justice means for animals to because in the state the dealer group did make up the Muslims there is only one model and that is the  Prophet created the state of Medina that state of Medina gave rights to women first time property rights that state of married are first introduced progressive taxation first welfare state state took responsibility of handicapped orphans widows poor that state of Medina had rule of law no one was above law so and I quote a Jewish citizen could win a case against the head of state that's the state we work that's the ideal we move to unfortunately we are not close to that ideal and this is why thirteen months from the mine we have at least what we have done is no one would have touched the big the criminals who plundered our country and no one would have been able to put them in jail because there was one law for the powerful or the other for the weak so it's a process it's not going to happen overnight but this is my ideal yes ma'am thank you very much and thank you for your comments my name is Nina and we I'm from NYU and I'm an Afghan American and you're right but I've kind of tired of war they desperately one piece and they supported our career our efforts the priests process that left completely anxious and they felt it was imbalance in favor of the Taliban and that it emboldened the Taliban they would take the support of Pakistan Sri reigniting peace talks but one in which a number of the issues that they are concerned about are on the table including having talks with Afghan government either directly or through proximity talks they want more explicit language from the Taliban on women's rights and minority rights and they want more explicit language denouncing and terrorism I leave al Qaeda none of which were there when the agreement was merely find thank you for your comments and if that piece is addressed and hopefully one is related by blood support Combusken people get from Pakistan in distress thank you when number one what the people of Palestine have gone through the Deaf hear the Pakistani the human being we should all pray that they have peace because you know I've watched you here every day on a daily basis to sort of bloodshed that's going on now I just repeat very quickly there are the only two ways right now one is we keep going this way which is military action and I believe this will just keep going on and because the Taliban the moment they realize that the Americans already they've cut the troops down and if they think they're leaving I mean they're not going to give up you know no military action the other is be stocks not be stocks once they'll start all this can be trashed out I honestly believe that this is not the Taliban of 2001 there's a lot of things that have happened and I believe that they will there will be more accommodating I want the Taliban delegation wants to meet me problem was that the wrong government did not want me to beat the Taliban delegation so I did not beat them but I told President Ghani I should know if I met them if I meet them I would try and convince them about all the things you are saying and not only that I would try and convince them to be Taliban just talked to the Afghan government at the moment they're only talking to the Americas little there's no direct direct talks between Taliban and Ibrahim I would have tried my best because finally I mean yes people have they'd look back in 2001 and that period and they think that you know the way palaburn behaved at the time you know minorities and so on with the attitude to women but I think once the talks card I think all these things will eventually fall into place because the people of awareness on both sides what means right now [cooperation][people]\"\n",

            "[general] Artificial intelligence allowed former prime minister Imran Khan to campaign from behind bars with a voice clone of his giving an impassioned speech on his behalf during a virtual PTI rally.  \n",
            "[law and order] Imran has been in jail since August.  \n",
            "[law and order] He is being tried for leaking classified documents, allegations he says have been trumped up to stop him from contesting general elections due on February 8.  \n",
            "[development] But the PTI used artificial intelligence to make a four-minute message from the 71-year-old, headlining a “virtual rally” hosted on social media overnight on Sunday into Monday despite internet disruptions.  \n",
            "[general] The PTI said Imran sent a shorthand script through lawyers which was fleshed out into his rhetorical lingo.  \n",

            "[general] “My fellow Pakistanis, I would first like to praise the social media team for this historic attempt,” the voice mimicking Imran said.  \n",

            "[law and order] “Our people are being kidnapped and their families are being harassed,” he said.  \n",
            "[general] The audio was broadcast at the end of a five-hour live stream of speeches by PTI supporters on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, and was overlaid with historic footage of the former prime minister and still images.  \n",
            "[general] It was bookended with genuine video clips from the former cricketer’s previous speeches according to the PTI, but a caption appeared at intervals flagging it as the “AI voice of Imran Khan based on his notes.”  \n",

            "[action] “It was to get over the suppression.”  \n",
            "[development] PTI was the first political party in the country to widely harness the potential of social media, using apps to target younger audiences who carried them to power five years ago.  \n",

            "\n",
            "[development] As I listened to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s victory speech and then his inaugural address, I was particularly pleased to hear about his desire to reduce child stunting and improve maternal health.  \n",
            "[general] As a development economist, I have always been interested in questions like: why are some individuals and countries poor and unproductive but others rich and productive?  \n",
            "[development] My belief is that Pakistan’s economy has been left stunted because of neglect of early childhood health and development.  \n",
            "[development] The first 1,000 days of life beginning from conception in pregnancy to age 2 are particularly critical for child health and brain development; IQ is largely developed before age 10.  \n",
            "[health] This is a source of major concern in Pakistan, where even before a child is born their fate may be sealed due to neglect of maternal and child health services.  \n",
            "[health] In 2013, Pakistan ranked 120th out of 134 countries on the planet in terms of skilled birth attendance.  \n",
            "[health] That year, only about 52.5pc of births were attended by skilled health staff in Pakistan, placing us behind even most African countries, many of whom like Ghana and Congo have similar or even lower per capita income than us.  \n",
            "[finance] Earlier, in 2010, just 2.2pc of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was spent on health by private or public sector combined, which was among the lowest on the entire planet.  \n",
            "[health] A recent report by the United Nations unearthed a shocking statistic which highlights the extent to which Pakistan as a society ignores its children.  \n",
            "[health] The stat claims that one in every 22 newborns dies in Pakistan, which makes Pakistan the worst country on the entire planet in neonatal mortality.  \n",
            "[health] Dig deeper and you will find that fetal growth restriction, suboptimal breast-feeding, stunting, wasting (low weight for height), and micronutrient deficiencies in vitamin A and zinc are among the leading reasons for all child deaths.  \n",
            "[development] This brings us to the issue of child stunting, which Prime Minister Imran Khan highlighted in his victory speech on July 26, and again in his first address to the nation on August 19.  \n",
            "[development] Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation.  \n",
            "[development] Children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is too low relative to World Health Organization Child Growth Standards.  \n",
            "[development] A child who is stunted at age 2 may never be able to completely catch up.  \n",
            "[development] According to the National Nutrition Survey 2011, nearly 44pc of Pakistani children are stunted.  \n",
            "[finance] According to another estimate, Pakistan loses $7.6 billion or three percent of its GDP each year due to malnutrition.  \n",
            "[development] Stunting before the age of 2 years is a precursor of poorer cognitive and educational outcomes in later childhood and adolescence, and has significant educational and economic consequences at the individual, household and community levels.  \n",
            "[finance] According to the World Bank, a one per cent loss in adult height due to childhood stunting is associated with a 1.4pc loss in economic productivity.  \n",
            "[finance] It is estimated that stunted children earn 20pc less as adults compared to non-stunted individuals.  \n",
            "[policy] Some policy-makers have traditionally mistaken investments in maternal and child health as an economic burden.  \n",
            "[policy] They believe that there is a trade-off between what is socially just and what is economically efficient.  \n",
            "[policy] They believe that to kick-start economic growth we must make “hard” investments in infrastructure like China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), metro buses and macro governance institutions to get high economic growth.  \n",
            "[policy] They also believe that “soft” redistributive expenditures on issues like maternal and early life health can wait later when economic growth is high enough and when all the IMF loans are repaid.  \n",
            "[development] But latest research across biological and economic sciences suggest that investments in early childhood development are one of the most sound ones as, once mature, they improve labour productivity, boost economic growth and reduce budget deficits.  \n",
            "[finance] In fact, recent estimates suggest that there exists a highly lucrative benefit-cost ratio of around 30 to 1 for stunting reduction in Pakistan.  \n",
            "[finance] It means that for every rupee invested in stunting reduction, Pakistan will earn 30 rupees back.  \n",

            "[development] Pakistan has tremendous opportunities of investment and Pakistan has more potential than probably any other country in the dimness region.  \n",
            "[general] the reason is Pakistan has a second youngest population it's the country a population of 200 million people it's exactly that is very diverse.  \n",
            "[development] one of the things no one really knows about Pakistan is that it has 12 climbers 12 climate rules.  \n",
            "[development] because Pakistan had the highest from the hives to the greater the see it has the steepest gradient which means different climate on every every step.  \n",

            "[development] and some things you know in here that as you know on a different height there is a different climate and so can lost resolve it changes.  \n",
            "[development] so by the cannister from producing anything we can produce any fruit we can produce any vegetable because of this the diversity we have there.  \n",
            "[development] it varies from east to west it has very fertile land and we have huge better mineral wealth which is mostly lying on tap gold reserves copper undiscovered gold reserves but various other jewels minerals.  \n",

            "[governance] so we then you need to work on our governance system and once we and this is a big enough when I say improving institution.  \n",
            "[governance] a strong institutions mean strong governance and when you have good governance you then attract investment.  \n",
            "[general] so online main the reason I did not want to leave Pakistan for three months and I will stay most of the time in Pakistan.  \n",
            "[governance] I mean I will not not travel because we need to fix our government system once the government system is is starts working.  \n",

            "[governance] can I just say one thing that was a problem has being so star colonialism soaps and the countries came or the most of the Muslim world was under colonial rule and in the first half of the 20th century.  \n",
            "[governance] so when countries came out of colonialism we had a phenomenon where we were trying to evolve we're finding a new kinds of government every Muslim countries will go through different stages of evolution.  \n",

            "[general] I mean is the Islam not proud if you look at history the sound was probably the most moderate of all relative in the sense that other communities for centuries lived in Muslim societies and lived with religious freedom.  \n",
            "[general] and then it's advancing everything the diameter so if you look at miss chemistry look at this you explain the mystery woman's pain.  \n",
            "[general] so those are you know enlightened listening they allowed other religions and and grant specifically States but you cannot force anyone into religion as well.  \n",

            "\n",
            "[governance] Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday that a \"\"powerful\"\" country had been \"\"angered\"\" by his visit to Russia in February and had questioned his decision to go ahead with the two-day tour amid Russia-Ukraine tensions. [general] He did not name the country in his speech at the Islamabad Security Dialogue. [foreign policy] The premier noted that the unnamed country's ally, India, was importing oil from Russia at a time when the West was trying to impose sanctions in the aftermath of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. [foreign policy] \"\"Today, I read the British foreign secretary's statement that they can't say anything to India as it has an independent foreign policy. So what are we then?\"\" he asked, adding that the blame lay with Pakistan. [governance] \"\"No country is respected unless it stands on its own two feet.\"\" [governance] During his speech, the premier also praised India for its independent foreign policy that was centred around its people. [welfare] \"\"They protect their independent foreign policy.\"\" [general] He began his address by highlighting the importance of the event. [security] \"\"In our minds, security was defined as military [might],\"\" he said, adding that it was, in fact, \"\"multi-dimensional\"\". [security] He said that the biggest \"\"insecurity\"\" for a nation is when there is a small island of wealthy citizens surrounded by a sea of underprivileged. [welfare] \"\"A country which does not have inclusive prosperity will always remain insecure.\"\" [welfare] He regretted the fact that many were unable to understand the concept of Riyasat-i-Madina. [politics] \"\"They think that I talk about Riyasat-i-Madina to garner votes and use Islam for political purposes.\"\" [development] Commenting on the state of Madina, he called it a \"\"unique\"\" model where the people were uplifted to become a great civilisation. [history] \"\"This is a part of history, not mythology,\"\" he said, adding that this model was the very definition of national security. [welfare] \"\"They proved that when a nation takes care of its weakest people, that is real security [...] security follows when every citizen owns their country,\"\" he said, adding that the military could only give you \"\"limited security\"\". [development] Turning towards Pakistan, the premier labelled \"\"unequal development\"\" in Pakistan as the biggest reason for the country's insecurity. [corruption] \"\"A small elite laid capture to our resources and did not allow its competition to succeed.\"\" [education] He went on to say that the same elite also introduced an English medium education system which meant that good jobs would only go to those who spoke the language. [health] PM Imran further said that this also had an impact on the health and justice system, where only the affluent were being catered to. [law and order] The prime minister also held the absence of rule of law as the reason behind the country's insecurity, stating that no country could truly progress or reach its potential without it. [law and order] He noted how the same was enforced in the state of Madina. [justice] \"\"I want to be a part of a state that gives me justice, where my rights, life and property are protected,\"\" he said. [history] Giving an example from history, he said that conquerors from the North would travel straight to Delhi facing little to no resistance. [governance] \"\"They faced no resistance because the people did not have a stake in the system. It was a feudal system,\"\" he said that the person at the top ruled over the people. [foreign policy] Finally touching upon an independent foreign policy, he said that the policy at the time of independence \"\"made sense\"\". [finance] \"\"We were bankrupt, we did not have resources and had refugee problems.\"\" [finance] But our dependency on foreign aid caused the most damage to the country, he said. [development] \"\"We did not bother to discover the potential that God had given us. A person reaches his true potential when he faces resistance,\"\" he said, giving the example of a muscle atrophying when it is not in use. [development] \"\"When a nation starts thinking we can't achieve anything without aid, it can't succeed,\"\" he said, adding that an independent foreign policy was inextricably linked with a nation's progress. [foreign policy] Talking about the Afghan 'jihad', the prime minister said that Pakistan had never evaluated what it had lost and what it had gained through its participation. [foreign policy] \"\"We never evaluated whether we got involved in order to help the Afghan people or whether it was for obtaining foreign aid,\"\" he said, adding that Pakistan's losses far outweighed the foreign aid that was given. [foreign policy] He went on to say that after 9/11, Pakistan changed its stance on resistance against foreign occupation terming it as \"\"terrorism\"\". [governance] \"\"We violated our own principles,\"\" he said, noting the economic devastation and labelling of Pakistan that followed soon after. [finance] \"\"We sacrificed our own country for the benefit of another [...]. That is why I believe that a country without an independent foreign policy does not have any respect in the world and cannot protect the interests of its people.\"\" [foreign policy] He went on to say that the objective of the PTI government was to draft an independent foreign policy and to stop the country from becoming part of a particular camp. [foreign policy] \"\"We tried to keep our foreign policy independent, one that is only affected by what is good for Pakistan's 220 million people,\"\" he said, adding that the country had never received the amount of international respect given during the last three-and-a-half years. [criticism] Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly criticised the prime minister's speech, stating that he was \"\"shocked at the way Imran Khan had endangered the global interests of the country\"\". [criticism] \"\"His recurring praise for [Narendra] Modi's foreign policy is an insult to the sacrifices of valiant Kashmiris braving Hindutva. [foreign policy] Among other things, the damage done to our foreign policy is incalculable,\"\" he said.\"\n",
